# How We Uncovered Disparities in Internet Service Offers

This repository contains code and data supporting our investigation "[Dollars to Megabits: You May Be Paying 400 Times as Much as your Neighbor for Internet](https://themarkup.org/still-loading)" from the series [Still Loading](https://themarkup.org/still-loading).

Our methodology is described in detail in "[How We Uncovered Disparities in Internet Deals Offered to Disadvantaged Communities](https://themarkup.org/still-loading)".

Please read that document to understand the context for the code and data in this repository.
The data in this repository, described in more detail below, include the results of our automated collecting of ISP offers, plus records from the Census and other sources necessary for the analysis. 

The code in this repository, also described in more detail below, demonstrates how we processed and analyzed that data. 


## Data
This directory is where inputs, intermediaries and outputs are saved.

Here is an overview of how the directory is organized:

```

Tables and figures featured in our methodology and story can be found in `data/ouput/tables` and `data/output/figs`, respectively.

The `data` directory also features `data/input` and `data/intermediary` files that were collected and processed to create the files in `data/output`. Their entirety is not stored in GitHub due to space restrictions. See [the section below](#Download-all-data) to access this data. 

In the `data/input` we stored historical redlining maps that were digitized by University of Richmond's [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58&text=intro) project (`data/input/redlining`), as well as [TIGER](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php) shapefiles from the U.S. Census (`data/input/census/shape`).

In `data/intermediary` you will find aggregated data from the American Community Survey (`data/intermediary/census`), and the FCC's Form 477 (`data/intermediary/fcc/bg_providers.csv`).

Below, we highlight three components of the data that we believe others will find most useful: all offers collected, by ISP; all offers collected, by ISP and city; and summary data regarding the disparities observed for each city-ISP combination.

### Offers by address
The address-level Internet service offers we collected are stored in the data/output/ directory, with one file per Internet service provider. (For instance, `data/output/speed_price_att.csv.gz` contains the offers we collected from AT&T.).

Those files contain the following columns:

| column                      | description                                                                                                                                    |

### Offer Maps
To view an interactive address-level map for the cities in our investigation, you can download the [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) maps for each provider.

Click any of the links below to view a map for the provider you are interested in.

- Map for [AT&T](https://markup-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/isp/at%26t-kepler.gl.html)
- Map for [CenturyLink](https://markup-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/isp/centurylink-kepler.gl.html)
- Map for [EarthLink](https://markup-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/isp/earthlink-kepler.gl.html)
- Map for [Verizon](https://markup-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/isp/verizon-kepler.gl.html)

Now you can use the search bar to quick travel to specific addresses or cities. If you know the areas, this will be immediately useful. However, if you would like an overlay of any socioeconomic factor in our investigation (median household income, the percentage of non-Hispanic Whites in the area, or redlining grades) we can produce them by request.

These maps should be viewed alongside summaries of how speeds vary across each city and between areas.

Please refer to the [methodology](https://TK) or this summary [file](#summary-of-disparities) for that information.

### Summary of Disparities
The `data/output/tables/table1_disparities_by_city.csv` file summarizes the disparities we observed for each city-ISP combination, and represents the core of our findings.

It contains the following:

### Download all data
Certain data files were too large to host on GitHub, but have been uploaded to Amazon Web Services' Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3):

`s3://markup-public-data/isp/input.tar.xz` (~7.7 GB uncompressed) contains open source addresses (`data/input/addresses/open_addresses_enriched` and `data/input/isp`), bulk data from government sources: the  U.S. Census (`data/input/census/acs5/`) and FCC Form 477 (`data/input/fcc/fbd_us_with_satellite_dec2020_v1.csv.gz`). 

`s3://markup-public-data/isp/isp-intermedairy.tar.xz` (~5.7 GB uncompressed) and contains API responses from each ISP (`data/intermediary/isp/`) appended to the geographic data we pulled in above.

For your convenience we have included a command-line script to download these files: 
```
data/download_external_data.sh
```


## Re-running Notebooks
### Python
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed, we used [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to create a Python 3.8 [virtual environment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56713819).


Install the Python packages with pip:<br>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The notebooks are intended to be run sequentially, but can also be run independently.
To run all notebooks in sequence, you can use the command 
```nbexec notebooks```

Note that when `recalculate = False` in each notebook, files that exist are not re-generated.

## Notebooks
The Python/Jupyter notebooks in this repository’s notebooks/ directory demonstrate the steps we took to process and analyze the data we collected. If you want a quick overview of the main methodology, you can skip directly to 3-statistical-tests-and-regression.ipynb.

### 0-get-acs-data.ipynb
This notebook collects data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. If you want to re-fetch this data, you'll need to register for an [API key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html), and assign it as the environment variable `CENSUS_API_KEY`. Otherwise, this is not necessary, as all outputs we used in this analysis are already saved in this repository.

### 1-process-offers.ipynb
This notebook parses and preprocesses the JSON responses for offers collected from each ISP's service lookup tools. The functions that parse each API response can be found in `noteobooks/parsers.py`.

See examples of the API response JSON in `data/intermediary/isp`, or [download](#Download-all-data) all the data.

### 2a-att-reports.ipynb / 2b-verizon-reports.ipynb / 2c-centurylink-reports.ipynb / 2d-earthlink-reports.ipynb
An overview of offers by each ISP. This contains breakdowns for each city served by the ISP by income-level, race/ethnicity, and historical redlining grades. 

The code to produce the charts in these notebooks can be found in `notebooks/aggregators.py`

### 3-statistical-tests-and-regression.ipynb
This notebook contains the bulk of our analyses. In it, we test for disparities in slow speed offers by income-level, race/ethnicity, and historical redlining grades.

This is also where we use logistic regression to adjust for business factors to see if accounting for them would eliminate the disparities we observed.

### 4-verizon-spotcheck.ipynb
This notebook examines Verizon's price changes, addressed in the limitations section of the methodology document.

### 5-find-closest-fiber-address.ipynb
This notebook uses scikit-learn's BallTree algorithm to find the closest address with blazing fast speeds (≥200 Mbps) for any address in a city. We used the results to create the topper graphic in the main story.
