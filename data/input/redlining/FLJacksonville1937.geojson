The land in this Section is principally elevated river frontage, the rear portion of which is flat and level. The Section is occupied by 100% whites, which includes the best class residents - executives and retired capitalists; in other words, a stable class of citizens not apt to move.  The annual income of occupants of this Section range from $6,000 to $25,000, with 90% home owners. There is no shifting of population in this Section and the predominant types of building are two-story brick and stucco residences ranging in price from $7,500 to $25,000, with many in excess of $25,000. The ages of the properties vary from 10 to 20 years, with repair condition ranging from good to excellent.  The Section has no particularly detrimental influences, while listed among the beneficial influences are good schools, parks, playgrounds, bus line transportation facilities, good elevation, location near two golf courses, uniformly developed and restricted subdivisions, while proximity to the St. Johns River tends to equalize temperatures and climatic conditions of the Section.  Sales prices at the low were from 60% to 65% of peak prices, although few sales have taken place in this Section.  Most of the property is strongly held, with little changing of ownership; consequently, sales volume at the low was about 60% of the peak volume and at the present time is estimated to be about 75% of the peak.  The Section was 100% occupied during the boom as it is likewise today, and was 90% occupied at the low. There are few rental properties in the Section and as the boom was of short duration, the influence of same on rental prices was of a minor nature.  In a few distress cases, rental prices at the low were about 65% to 70% of the peak prices, but at the present time have recovered to about 85% or 90% of the peak.  Rental property in this Section in that portion from the River to two blocks back has a rental value of from $100 per month upward, while the remaining property in the Section has a rental value of from $60 to $100 per month.  There is no surplus of housing in the Section and very small demand for new houses, in view of the present trend to South Jacksonville and the Beaches.  There is only a small amount of new residential construction in the Section and it consists principally of high class residences and modern apartments in the Avondale portion of the Section.  The H.O.L.C. received very few applications from this section and foreclosures were the lightest in the Section of any area in Jacksonville.

The section contains subdivisions known as San Marco, Villa Alexandria, River Oaks, and Granada.  The land ranges from 3 to 20 feet above river level for about 6 miles from the city and is principally level, flat land, with outlying portinos heavily wooded.  Occupants of this Section are 100% white and consist of the higher class salaried workers, professional workers, and the well-to-do with annual incomes ranging from $6,000 to $15,000.  The occupants of the Section are 90% home owners and there is no shifting of population.  One and two-story brick and stucco residences ranging in prices from $5,000 to $25,000 predominate; the ages of these properties range from 1 to 9 years and practically all are in excellent condition, with no repairs needed.  The principal detrimental influence affecting this Section is the congestion of vehicular traffic during the rush hours, due to the East Coast tourist traffic and construction activities in this Section and the Beaches, all of which must cross one bridge between South Jacksonville and the center of the City; however, even with this congested traffic the Section is much more accessible than any other area in Jacksonville and furthermore, the contemplated new bridge will relieve this situation.  Principal beneficial influences in addition to the proximity to the St. Johns River are the good schools, parks, playgrounds, bus lines and ferry service to heart of the City. Plus the proximity of the Section itself to the center of the City.  Other beneficial influences are the facts that the sub-divisions in this Section are highly restricted, are well planned, and contain large lots which have attracted purchasers to this area, whereas the older areas of the City contain smaller lots.  Most of this Section has been developed since the boom and present sales prices are at the peak, with evidence that they will continue to increase; these prices are now up from 20% to 25% above the low.  In as much as the supply of improved property in this Section is limited and emand is strong, plus the further face that there are ample mortgage funds available for financing the purchase of homes over a twenty-year period with 20% cash payment, it is believed that sales prices in this Section will continue to advance.  The present sales volume is at least four times that of the low.  The Section was 90% occupied at the low and is 100% occupied at the present time.  There is very little rental property available in the Section and present rental prices are estimated to be up almost 20% from the low, present rentals in the Section ranging from $50 to $100 per month.  There is no surplus of housing in the Section, but there is a demand for new houses, as indicated by the ready sale of new residential construction in Jacksonville in the last 18 months has taken place in this Section and present indications are that this activity will continue to increase.

Both Colonial Manor and the eastern portion of River Oaks are new sub-divisions, and at the present time only one street (Greenridge Road) in Colonial Manor has been improved with residences.  The land in these five sub-divisions is level and flat and is occupied by 100% whites of the medium-salaried class workers, whose annual incomes range from $1,200 to $3,000.  With the exception of Fletcher Park, 90% of the occupants of the Section are home owners (Fletcher Park about 80%).  Property in Fletcher Park felt the influence of the depression less than any other area in Jacksonville and at the present time this section, with the possible exception of Fletcher Park, is showing a tendency toward higher income occupants, Fletcher Park remaining stationary in this respect.  One-story frame and stucco bungalows ranging in price from $2,250 to $3,750 predominate, along with some two-story brick veneer duplexes ranging in price from $3,500 to $6,000.  With the exception of Fletcher Park, properties in this Section range from 1 to 15 years old and are in fair condition, needing only minor repairs.  Properties in Fletcher Park, however, were built during the World War by the Federal Government for shipyard workers and a superior grade of construction was utilized even though all of the properties are uniform and have no architectural individuality; due to this superior construction, the properties in Fletcher Park today are in good condition and need no repairs.  The principal detrimental influences of the entire Section are the Section's proximity to the Florida East Coast Railroad, proximity to lumber yards, and congestion of vehicular traffic during rush hours over St. Johns bridge.  The beneficial influences are the good schools, parks, playgrounds, and the Section's accessibility to the beaches; furthermore, the Section is about 3 miles from the center of the City and is almost entirely surrounded by water, thus equalizing the climatic conditions of the Section.  River Oaks and Colonial Manor were not in existence during the boom, consequently cannot be included in the discussion of sales prices, sales volume, rental prices, or occupancy fluctuations.  Sales prices in the remaining portions of this Section at the low were about 50% to 60% of the peak prices and have since recovered to about 70% to 75%, while sales volume at the low was about 50% of the peak volume and has since recovered to about 70%.  Occupancy in these older areas was 100% at the peak, was 80% at the low, and is 100% at the present time.  Rental prices at the low were about 50% of the peak prices and have recovered to about 75%; howsoever, it should be borne in mind that there is little rental property available in this Section, present rentals of that which is available for rent ranging from $25 to $40 per month.  There is no surplus of housing in Fletcher Park, which is completely built up, but in the remaining portions of this Section there has been in the past 18 months a good demand for new houses.

One-story frame bungalows ranging in price from $1,500 to $3,000, predominate, with an age range of from 6 to 15 years; most of them are in fair condition and need only minor repairs.  The detrimental influences of the Section are the Section's distance from the center of the City (about 4 miles) with only fair transportation facilities available, and only a small portion of the Section has paved streets, sidewalks, or sewerage.  The principal beneficial influence of the Section, in addition to its proximity to the river, is the fact that new residential construction is of a slightly better type and grade than other houses in the Section.  This Section was only sparsely developed during the boom, sales prices at the low were about 50% of peak prices, having since recovered to about 65%, while sales volume at the low was about 25% to 35% of the peak volume and has since recovered to about 50%.  The Section was 90% occupied at the peak, was almost 70% occupied at the low, and is about 80% to 85% occupied at the present time, while rental prices at the low were about 50% of the peak prices and have since recovered to about 70%, with present rentals ranging from $20 to $30 per month.  There is no surplus of housing and small demand for new housing.  There is a moderate amount of new residential construction in the Section, consisting chiefly of one-story frame residences, the average value of which is about $2,500.  Foreclosures in this section were light - from 10% to 15% - because the Section was comparatively new.  Scattered vandalism is present in the sparsely developed portions of the Section.  The principal auto trailer camp inside the City limits of Jacksonville is located on the west side of Main Street in this Section.\n"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.661929,30.317805],[-81.661017,30.316377],[-81.657965,30.316389],[-81.657328,30.316353],[-81.65728,30.314814],[-81.655224,30.314793],[-81.655094,30.31307],[-81.653497,30.313053],[-81.651647,30.313131],[-81.651612,30.317666],[-81.649532,30.317153],[-81.649533,30.315656],[-81.643522,30.313471],[-81.642424,30.313766],[-81.642196,30.313735],[-81.641761,30.311938],[-81.641597,30.311409],[-81.641162,30.311569],[-81.64159,30.313698],[-81.641162,30.313975],[-81.641105,30.314271],[-81.641026,30.314566],[-81.640877,30.314646],[-81.640584,30.314616],[-81.640484,30.314493],[-81.640798,30.314],[-81.640855,30.313428],[-81.640606,30.313224],[-81.640256,30.312197],[-81.640099,30.311008],[-81.639401,30.311184],[-81.639722,30.312759],[-81.639579,30.31303],[-81.638988,30.312956],[-81.637519,30.312409],[-81.635622,30.311411],[-81.634759,30.311147],[-81.63376,30.310948],[-81.633755,30.309994],[-81.632614,30.309871],[-81.632005,30.309772],[-81.63096,30.309698],[-81.63017,30.309559],[-81.629372,30.309485],[-81.628507,30.309419],[-81.628107,30.309452],[-81.627426,30.306705],[-81.626361,30.303266],[-81.626351,30.302962],[-81.626084,30.302061],[-81.626876,30.302091],[-81.627269,30.302171],[-81.630561,30.303556],[-81.630739,30.303977],[-81.630953,30.303977],[-81.634494,30.305044],[-81.636307,30.305748],[-81.637904,30.306234],[-81.638069,30.305986],[-81.639392,30.30449],[-81.640521,30.304551],[-81.642586,30.304663],[-81.644055,30.304589],[-81.644661,30.304347],[-81.64738,30.30326],[-81.648158,30.304573],[-81.645548,30.305767],[-81.644549,30.308651],[-81.64574,30.308804],[-81.647587,30.309162],[-81.649091,30.309463],[-81.650039,30.310528],[-81.650474,30.310522],[-81.651309,30.310048],[-81.651437,30.309394],[-81.652649,30.309148],[-81.653148,30.309017],[-81.654462,30.308674],[-81.654343,30.30813],[-81.654222,30.30766],[-81.658103,30.305913],[-81.658076,30.307677],[-81.658229,30.308017],[-81.658268,30.308643],[-81.659039,30.308643],[-81.660079,30.308643],[-81.660207,30.310404],[-81.661947,30.310342],[-81.662014,30.314682],[-81.664884,30.314758],[-81.663869,30.316377],[-81.662657,30.31863],[-81.661929,30.317805]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C4","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"1":"This Section contains parts of Palm Park, Locarno, Reed's sub-division, St. Nicholas, Meridale, Oklahoma, Shadyside, and the central business district of South Jacksonville.

Section contains all of the areas on the Realty Area map which are classified as hazardous and embraces principally the negro areas of the City.  Some of the principal sub-divisions in this Section are Barnett's Sub-division, Durkesville, Campbell's Addition to East Jacksonville, Cunningham and McIntosh, Vanoe, Drydale, Blum's Addition, North Lavilla, Mimsburg, Royal Terrace, Monorief Park, Burbridge's Addition, Mooney's Addiiton, Windle Smith's Addition, North End, part of Lavilla, Lincold Villas, part of St. Elmore, part of Brooklyn, Campbell Hill, Highland Heights, and the negro section of South Jacksonville.  Most of the land in this Section is level, flat, and rather low; it is occupied 100% by negroes, except in the outlying portions where white are intermingled to the extent of about 25%.  The annual incomes of most of the inhabitants in this Section range from $120 to $540 and about 15% to 20% of the properties are occupied by home-owners.  This particular race of people (negroes) have been the greatest sufferers during the depression, chiefly because they were laid off first and will be the last to be re-employed as business conditions improve.  There is no shifting of population in the section and in a small area on Eigth Street between Jefferson and Davis and Moncrief up to Twelfth Street there is a community of the best class of negroes.  The predominant type of building in this best grade negro portion of this section is one and two-story brick veneer, stucco and frame residences ranging in price from $2,500 to $7,500, which are occupied 100% by home-owners, the highest type of colored citizens.  In the remainder of the section one-story frame buildings ranging from $600 to $3,000 predominate and the ages of these buildings vary from 10 to 40 years.  The conditions of some range from poor to very poor, with some needing major and minor repairs and some needing demolition; so-called \"slum areas\" are scattered throughout the entire negro district.  The principal detrimental influences are the lack of modern civic improvements - paved streets, sidewalks, drainage and sanitation facilities - and the congested cheap class of frame construction, constituting definite fire hazard, plus the fact that this section contains the highest percentage of juvenile delinquency, infant mortality, and undesirable criminal elements.  The Section has no particularly beneficial influences.  There were no sales during the low in this section and present sales prices are about 35% to 40% of the peak prices, while present sales volume is about 10% to 15% of the peak volume.  The section was about 90% to 95% occupied during the peak, was about 40%...."}}}]}
