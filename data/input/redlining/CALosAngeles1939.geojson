Due to type of occupancy, transportation is entirely by privately owned automobiles or taxi service. Proximity to Westwood and Beverly Hills provides conveniently available schools, churches, trading and amusement centers. This area consists of three subdivisions: Bel-Air, Holmby Hills and Beverly Estates, all of which have been developed within the past 15 years in an orderly manner and under efficient sponsorship. This area represents, without question, the highest type of residential construction and maintenance in Los Angeles County. Homesites range in size to from 2 to 15 acres, which sell for from $7500-12500 per acre. Cost pf three recent improvements, including sites in Holmby Hills, were reported to be $80000, $100000, and $110000. It is noticeable that new construction is along conservative lines but represents the highest type of architectural skill. Extensive improvements of less pretentious character, in a price range of $25000-$35000, have taken place in Stone Canyon and tributary valleys in the past 3 years. Sales demand in the area is good. It should be borne in mind, however, that for sale purposes there is normally a high ratio of depreciation from cost prices in improvements of the mansion type.

The northeast section is more pretentions than the balance of the area. There are some over-improvements in the section south of Cahuenga Blvd. which gives it a somewhat spotted appearance.

The upward trend of desirability of this area will continue for a number of years and it is therefore accorded a “low green” grade.","9":"Burbank and Glendale 1st A-4 3-27-39","10":"Caution: This area is currently affected in whole or in part by an Ad valorem Tax District.

While this area has all the physical characteristics of the highest grade, this factor coupled with its being surrounded by lower grade districts leads to the assignment of a “low green” grade.","9":"Leimert Park 1st - A-47 3-15-39","10":"","71":"8-1939","72":"54.5","1a":"Rapidly N/A N/A","1b":"Business and professional men, minor executives, white collar clericals, etc. Income $2400-5000","1c":"0 -","1d":"0","1e":"None apparent","2a":"5-7 rooms (largely 6's) N/A","2b":"Stucco N/A","2c":"2 years N/A","2d":"Good N/A","2e":"98% N/A","2f":"95% N/A","2g":"New area N/A","2h":"4750-7000 N/A N/A N/A","2i":"1939 4750-7000 N/A N/A N/A","2j":"Good N/A","2k":"Static N/A","2l":"Not a rental area N/A","2m":"N/A N/A N/A N/A","2n":"N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A","2o":"N/A N/A","2p":"N/A N/A","4a":"0","4b":"0","5a":"0","5b":"0"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-118.332783,34.003508],[-118.333211,34.002483],[-118.333876,34.00207],[-118.333781,34.001636],[-118.333876,34.000848],[-118.334874,33.998937],[-118.335373,33.998365],[-118.336562,33.99803],[-118.337441,33.99736],[-118.33813,33.996513],[-118.339509,33.995803],[-118.341197,33.994917],[-118.342718,33.994779],[-118.344334,33.998227],[-118.344643,33.999508],[-118.344643,34.000533],[-118.344429,34.001163],[-118.343835,34.002207],[-118.342741,34.003114],[-118.341719,34.003449],[-118.341767,34.003981],[-118.340959,34.005498],[-118.3392,34.006325],[-118.336158,34.00733],[-118.335421,34.007192],[-118.334304,34.004927],[-118.332783,34.003508]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"A48","holc_grade":"A","area_description_data":{"0":"Los Angeles County","2":"90 N/A","3":"20 2 story frame and stucco $12500-25000 Owner built","5":"3","6":"Ample","8":"Terrain: Rolling, hillside to hilltop.

This area is composed of two or more subdivisions, all of which have been placed upon the market within the past 20 years. Development has been steady and without the aid of promotional effort. Many new homes have been built during the past several years ranging from modest 5-room bungalows to spacious mansions surrounded by large grounds and orchards. Activity has been most pronounced in the eastern and southern parts of the area. Construction is from good to extra standard quality. Maintenance is of excellent character, and architectural designs are attractive. Population is homogeneous and location is a highly desirable on account of its proximity to Whittier College. The price ranges shown above are nominal, being based upon an average size home site. This area is not adversely affected by Area C-134 which abuts on the west as the rugged terrain affords a physical barrier to influences from the lower grade area.

Construction ranges from standard to extra standard quality. Maintenance is of excellent character and architectural designs are individually attractive and collectively harmonious. Population is homogeneous. The hatched portion to the northwest is a separate subdivision which has just been placed upon the market. Approximately 12 residences are now in course of construction; judging from these improvements, will be more pretentious than those in the unhatched portion. Adjacency to the Lakewood Gold and Country Club is a favorable influence. Reasonable lot values from $12.50 per front foot up are said to have also increased popularity.

Proximity to oil wells, refineries, etc. is a detrimental influence; however, no odors were detected and informed local opinion is that this factor is not a deterrent. Recent drilling for oil, east of Cherry and south of Carson, brought in a \"dry well\" and a movement is said to be on foot to get the county to zone against future operations of this kind. If this is successful it is said that vacant property east of California and south of San Antonio Drive will be subdivided and developed in harmony with this area.

Land improved 10% out of maximum of 50%. Deed restrictions provide for minimum improvement cost of $6000 with construction supervised by subdividers. Restrict ownership to the Caucasian race in perpetuity. All providers are strictly enforced. Deed restrictions formerly provided for a much higher minimum cost of improvement but were modified as above some 5 years ago. Conveniences are very largely lacking. Schools, churches, trading centers and transportation all being inadequate. This area was formerly part of an old Spanish grant which was taken over by Frank Vanderlop, formerly Secretary of Treasury, who began active development in 1923. Compared with other sections of the city development has been exceedingly slow. Modification being at a peak at the present time. The location has great charm and offers a magnificent view of the Pacific Ocean. Construction and maintenance are of excellent quality. Architectural designs are of the best and population is highly homogeneous. The area is protected from the adverse influence of area C-161 to the north by virtue of the hill terrain. Improvements range from expensive 6 room dwellings to mansions with large surrounding estates. There is no predominating type. One authority ventures the opinion that “Palos Verdes Estates” is one of the highest class subdivisions is Southern California. The northern part of this area (north of the Palos Verdes line) is a separate subdivision known as “Hollywood Riviera”. The characteristics of this section are very similar those of Palos Verdes Estates; however, deed restrictions have not been modified and minimum improvement requirements are so high that land improved is only about 5%, and it is not believed that a successful development is feasible until some adjustment of restrictions is made. This subdivision was placed upon the market some 25 years ago. Under normal conditions this area, as a whole, should make rapid strides during the next 10 years and it is assigned a “hatched green” grade.","9":"Palos Verdes Estates and Hollywood Riviera Hatched 1st A-59 3-20-39","10":"","71":"7-1938","72":"58.5","1a":"Moderately N/A N/A","1b":"Professional and business men, retired capitalists executives, etc. Income $5000-10000 and up","1c":"0 -","1d":"0","1e":"More moderate income families are coming in as a result of deed restriction modification","2a":"Well built 6 room to manison type dwellings N/A","2b":"Stucco N/A","2c":"10 years N/A","2d":"Good N/A","2e":"99% N/A","2f":"95% N/A","2g":"7500 and up N/A","2h":"7500 and up N/A N/A N/A","2i":"1939 7500 and up N/A N/A N/A","2j":"Poor to fair N/A","2k":"Static N/A","2l":"Not a rental area N/A","2m":"N/A N/A N/A N/A","2n":"N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A","2o":"- N/A","2p":"- N/A","4a":"0","4b":"Few","5a":"0","5b":"Few"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-118.226784,34.150547],[-118.226299,34.152506],[-118.221365,34.151125],[-118.220837,34.152223],[-118.220745,34.152564],[-118.220181,34.152706],[-118.219553,34.152765],[-118.218641,34.15267],[-118.218099,34.152139],[-118.2176,34.151549],[-118.217286,34.151538],[-118.216701,34.151868],[-118.216159,34.152505],[-118.213706,34.153261],[-118.212409,34.154205],[-118.211895,34.1545],[-118.211468,34.154488],[-118.210569,34.154346],[-118.209614,34.154464],[-118.209072,34.154724],[-118.208259,34.155479],[-118.208016,34.15581],[-118.207218,34.156175],[-118.206633,34.156423],[-118.205164,34.155597],[-118.204908,34.155302],[-118.204793,34.154948],[-118.204922,34.154523],[-118.205164,34.154157],[-118.205007,34.153862],[-118.204023,34.153839],[-118.203624,34.153567],[-118.203196,34.152977],[-118.203011,34.152529],[-118.203225,34.152257],[-118.204109,34.152234],[-118.206148,34.152198],[-118.207218,34.152069],[-118.208116,34.151797],[-118.210812,34.150617],[-118.210997,34.150228],[-118.210897,34.149909],[-118.209328,34.149295],[-118.209086,34.149083],[-118.209799,34.147596],[-118.21345,34.148717],[-118.21402,34.149047],[-118.214576,34.149047],[-118.21566,34.148705],[-118.216544,34.148516],[-118.2173,34.148504],[-118.218013,34.148634],[-118.219054,34.149095],[-118.226784,34.150547]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"A6","holc_grade":"A","area_description_data":{"0":"Los Angeles County","2":"90 N/A","3":"75 6-7 rooms $6500-$8500 Readily","5":"3","6":"Ample","8":"Terrain: Level to rolling valley between ranges of hills to north and south.

Conveniences are not readily available. This exclusive and sequestered district was subdivided in 1925 and has been slowly developed since that time. A re-subdivision of some of the large acreage plots was recently made with the mutual consent of all property owners of the area. This will undoubtedly stimulate further development as the district is very highly regarded. Construction, architectural designs and maintenance are of the very highest character. It is not practical to designate a predominating type and size or to give price brackets as extent of home sites largely govern prices. In a general way it might be states that estates have cost owners from $25000 to $1000000. The area has been very carefully developed and population is homogeneous, and has a high community pride. Remoteness and comparatively small number of improvements preclude assignment of the highest grade, but it is thought that pattern and prospects are definite enough to warrant assignment of a “medial green” grade.","9":"Flintridge 1st A-8 4/4/39","10":"","71":"7-1938","72":"56.25, Co. $44.42 - City $11.83","1a":"Moderately N/A N/A","1b":"Business and professional men, retired people, executives, etc. Income $5000 and up","1c":"0 --","1d":"0","1e":"None apparent","2a":"Mansions and estates N/A","2b":"Masonry, frame and stucco N/A","2c":"8 years N/A","2d":"Good N/A","2e":"99% N/A","2f":"95% N/A","2g":"Not possible to establish prices on this type of area.

However, this handicap is said to be in process of being overcome. This is the best part of the incorporated town of Southgate, development of which began between 15 and 20 years ago. This area was overburdened with overlapping Ad Valorem tax districts, which retarded development until the bonds were redeemed and an adjustment made in the early part of 1938. Since then building activity, under stimulus of FHA Title II financing, has been very great, particularly in southwest portion, and a complete reversal of trend has taken place. Construction of older dwellings were of only fair standard quality, but current building is of much higher quality. Maintenance is generally of good character. Owing to a wide differential in age and architectural designs, the area has a somewhat heterogeneous aspect. Population is inclined to be homogeneous.

Deed restrictions vary but all are said to be effective and afford protection against racial hazards. Conveniences are all readily available. This area is composed of subdivisions known as “Belmont Shores” and “Naples”, both being in the nature of high grade beach resort developments. However, there are an increasing number of permanent residences being built, and the area has been very active during the past 3 or 4 years. Construction is of high standard quality and maintenance is of good character. Architectural designs are generally attractive but undersized lots and irregular platting gives parts of area a crowded aspect. Owing to lack of uniformity in size, lot values are hard to estimate; based upon a 120 ft. depth they will probably range from $25 to $50, probably more for frontages on the Rivo Alto Canal, which are 30 ft. with little depth. In spite of shifting nature population gives the impression of homogeneity. Occupancy is irregular and changes with the seasons; for the same reason rentals are not constant and brackets shown above are only nominal and are upon a yearly lease basis. Across the Marine Stadium, which borders are on the northeast, are some producing oil wells, but they are apparently not considered a detrimental factor.

Land improved 60% of possible 85%. Deed restricted in part but provision loosely drawn. Zoning is mostly single-family with multi-family permitted in parts. Availability of conveniences varies with location, from fair to good. Development of this area, which began some 20 years ago, has been irregular, then distinct waves of activity having been experienced, the last of these beginning in 1936 under stimulus of FHA financing, has been the most intense and is still under way. This intermittent activity has resulted in a spotted and more or less inharmonious aspect. New construction is of much better quality than the old, being of standard quality or better. This has had the effect of raising the grade of the whole area. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy of raising the grade of the whole area. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy and architectural designs are generally attractive. There are many scatter blocks located near arroyos or below steep hillsides where there are real flood or landslide hazards. However, well-conceived control projects have done much to minimize such dangers and in many cases such hazards are more mental than real. Las Encino’s Canyon properties have suffered most in the past from this menace. The area is an isolated one and, as has been indicated, is inclined to heterogeneity, and this is particularly true of the section west of Canada Blvd. The greatest activity has been in the northern part of the area and it is there that most of the multi-family structures are located. These are built in harmony with other improvements and are not considered subversive. The area as a whole and the surrounding hills are more or less heavily wooded and, while apparently not so considered, seems to offer a very definite fire hazard. The current trend of desirability in this area is distinctly upward, but it is there accorded a “low blue” grade.","9":"Verdugo Woodlands 2nd - B-16 3-25-39","10":"Caution: This area is currently affected in whole or in part by an Ad valorem Tax District.

This is a new subdivision which has been developed within the last 5 years under the stimulus of promotional effort and FHA financing. Construction meets the administration’s requirements and architectural designs are attractive although it is obvious that some of them have been built speculatively. Population, which is of the medium income level, is homogeneous, maintenance evidences pride o ownership. Favorable influences are: consistency and newness of improvements, proximity to good schools, regular “set backs” and excellent street improvements. Negative influences: proximity to industry, Southern Pacific Railway and Grand Central Airport. It also might be mentioned that high percent of home ownership is due to low equity financing and that properties are form 10% to 15% overpriced.

Improvements are less imposing in southwest portion. Proximity to Chevy Chase Country Club and unique location are favorable influences.

Some steep grades increase construction costs. Land improved 35%. Deed restrictions are quite moderate in their provisions, but afford racial protection. Zoning: single-family residential. Conveniences are all available but transportation is dependent upon bus service. This area was subdivided some 15 years ago, but owing to rugged nature of terrain did not prove popular. In the past 2 or 3 years, however, under stimulus of promotional effort and FHA financing, activity has greatly increased. Construction, particularly the new imrpovements, is of goo character. Maintenance in general indicates pride of occupancy, and population is homogeneous.

Most streets are improved but are generally short dead-end thoroughfares emanating from Linda Vista Avenue. This area was originally a chicken ranch district, and its transition to a residential section began about 1925. Street and other improvements were financed through an issue of Ad valorem Tax Bonds, popularly known as Mattoon District Bonds. This indebtedness in conjunction with the depression retarded development, and it was not until the bond issue was refunded and the advent of the FHA that activity was resumed. Population, improvements, maintenance and architectural designs are all of a heterogeneous character. Many of the old 4 and 5 room ranch type bungalows are still in existence and in spite of many new well-constructed dwellings they give the area a spotted appearance. Distance from conveniences, poor transportation facilities and lack of deed restrictions are also unfavorable factors. Favorable influences are: large number of high grade improvements, rapid increase of better quality inhabitants, and indications of continuance of building activity.

No construction hazards. Land improved 90%. Deed restrictions have largely expired except provisions protecting against subversive racial elements. Zoning is single-family residential. Conveniences are all readily available. This area has been slowly developing, without high pressure salesmanship, for the past 30 years. Many original owners are still residents, occupying the palisades overlooking the “Arroyo Seco” in which is located the far-famed “Rose Bowl” and less known but important “Municipal Golf Course”. This area is popular with retired people and visitors seeking winter quarters. Improvements, while heterogeneous on account of age, are splendidly maintained. Under stimulus of FHA Title II financing there has been quite a little activity in new construction during the past few years. This has been of good quality and has been largely concentrated in two comparatively small sections – one located between Canada Blvd. and Howard St. east of Channing Way, improvements have had a favorable influence upon the area. Unfavorable factors are the fourth grade areas to the west, which are heavily infiltrated with subversive racial elements. Deed protection against these racial hazards protect this area from direct contamination but are, nevertheless, a bad influence. Efforts are being made to overcome this hazard. In many respects this area has first grade qualifications but age and the racial situation precludes assigning better than a medial blue grade.","9":"East side of Arroyo 2nd B-28 4-5-39","10":"","71":"7-1938","72":"48.8 County $36.90 City $11.90","1a":"Moderately N/A N/A","1b":"Business and professional men, executives, retired poeple, white collar clerical, etc. Income $2400-5000 and up","1c":"Few None subversive","1d":"0","1e":"None apparent","2a":"8 to 10 rooms 5, 6 and  rooms ( some mansion)","2b":"Frame, stucco and masonry Frame and stucco","2c":"22 years 15 years","2d":"Good Good","2e":"95% 98%","2f":"85% 90%","2g":"6750-9000 4000-6000","2h":"7500-10000 N/A 4250-6250 N/A","2i":"1939 7500-10000 N/A 4500-6500 N/A","2j":"Fair Fair to good","2k":"Static Static","2l":"50-75 35-50","2m":"75-90 N/A 37.50-55 N/A","2n":"1939 75-95 N/A 37.50-55 N/A","2o":"Fair to good Good","2p":"Static - slightly better in winter season Static - Better in winter","4a":"0","4b":"Few","5a":"1","5b":"Few"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-118.121431,34.178494],[-118.120537,34.178503],[-118.12021,34.178453],[-118.120121,34.178208],[-118.1201,34.177275],[-118.120062,34.175651],[-118.12021,34.17543],[-118.121815,34.175406],[-118.121963,34.175356],[-118.121934,34.174177],[-118.121785,34.172358],[-118.123211,34.172309],[-118.123063,34.171178],[-118.123152,34.17076],[-118.125915,34.170686],[-118.130282,34.170612],[-118.131084,34.170662],[-118.131144,34.171596],[-118.131059,34.176617],[-118.130965,34.182165],[-118.128499,34.182214],[-118.128499,34.183984],[-118.130936,34.184008],[-118.130817,34.187596],[-118.128618,34.187572],[-118.12841,34.187449],[-118.12844,34.185974],[-118.128262,34.185802],[-118.125944,34.185876],[-118.123181,34.185901],[-118.123241,34.185188],[-118.123211,34.183295],[-118.123181,34.180764],[-118.123241,34.178724],[-118.123092,34.178478],[-118.121431,34.178494]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B29","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"0":"Los Angeles County Los Angeles County","2":"85 90 N/A N/A","3":"35 15 6 room $5500-6000 5 and 6 rooms $4500-7500 Moderately Owner built","5":"3 3","6":"Ample Ample","8":"Terrain: Level with favorable grades.

No construction hazards. It is difficult to estimate the land improved owing to fact that homesites run from 1 to 20 acres. Deed restriction shave expired upon 75% of area and more will expire on January 1, 1940. An effort to renew or extend provisions providing racial protection is meeting with success. This unincorporated territory is under County government whose zoning ordinances are inadequate. Public transportation is inadequate, shopping centers are distant from parts of area. Schools are good and readily available, and church facilities are convenient. Up to 1905 this area was largely citrus groves, and development began by the purchase of these groves by eastern people for winter homes, who replaced the ranch homes with imposing mansions. This, by and large, is the pattern of the area. Many of the old being super standard. Maintenance, likewise, shows high pride of possession. Architectural designs, as well as landscaping, are individualists and add glamour to the district. This area gives evidence of having been the “melting pot” of the upper income brackets of the nation. This is indicated by the wholesale manner in which indigenous plant life of the various sections of our nation have been injected into the decorative features of those various estates. Horticultural and floricultural novelties of all sections of the nation have been introduced into the decorative scheme of the various holdings. The evergreens of the eastern seaboard and Pacific Northwest are particularly in evidence, and on New Year’s Eve, Santa Anita Avenue is a blaze with an electrical display from these evergreens which border that thoroughfare. There is, however indications of a transition in the area. While many original owners are still residents, properties are more and more passing into control of 2nd and 3rd generation owners. This is definitely suggested by the fact that within the past few years several of these old estates, which for various reasons, have become alienated from original owners, have been subdivided; the old mansions demolished and less pretentious structures and grounds have taken their place. This is particularly obvious in the district between Calaveras and Mariposa Sts. and Santa Anita and El Molino Aves. In this district at least one old estate has been subdivided and 20 new 5 to 7 room bungalows of modern design and extra standard construction have been erected on generous sized lots to take the place of the old improvements. Demolition of another original old mansion was observed in another part of the area. What this portended could not be learned, but there is no doubt that this district is in a transition period. If imagination were allowed full sway, based upon recent developments, a 1st grade might logically be assigned, based upon residential desirability over the next 10 or 15 years. However, the area as a whole gives no such optimistic indication and, based upon present definite prospects, it is thought that all that is justified is a grade of “high yellow” with the suggestion that a future survey will break the area down into several grades. Terrain: Level with favorable grades. No construction hazards. Land improved 90%. Deed restrictions have expired but pattern of improvements are definitely established and racial hazards are at a minimum. Zoning is mixed single-family and multiple family. Conveniences all readily available including rapid transit to Los Angeles. This is the most popular and best district in South Pasadena and, although some 30 years old, many original owners are still occupants. Construction is largely extra standard. Maintenance is of character that offsets age and obsolescence. Architectural designs, with few exceptions, are attractive and as a whole are harmonious. Population is homogeneous. The section bounded by as a whole are harmonious. Population is homogeneous. The section bounded by Monterey Road, Garfield Avenue, Oak Avenue and Milan Avenue would almost merit a first grade classification. The area as a whole will undoubtedly trend toward rental properties on account of the natural advantages of its location, being not only close to conveniences but also to Los Angeles transportation. Lot values are stabilized at around $25 to $30 a front foot. This area should retain its desirability for many years to come and is accorded a “high blue” grade.","9":"Altadena South Pasadena 3rd + 2nd + B-37 C-25 4-6-39 4-11-39","10":" ","71":"7-1938 7-1938","72":"36.90 County 51.59","1a":"Slowly N/A N/A N/A N/A Yes","1b":"Retired and active capitalists, executives, business and professional men.

Construction in both periods was of good quality from the appearance of the area. Construction in both periods was of good quality and maintenance generally indicates pride of occupancy. While new improvements are scattered throughout the area they predominate in the northeast section, while the older structures are more numerous in the central portion. There is said to be considerable speculative building in the area which have not been sold and constitute an “overhang”. The area is well located and were it not for newer competing area would probably make a better showing under the circumstances it is felt that a “low blue” grade is all that is warranted.","9":"North Hollywood 2nd - B-6 3-30-39","10":"Caution: This area is currently affected in whole or in part by an Ad valorem Tax District.

This is a multi-automobile area and is only 5 minutes drive to Hollywood where all conveniences are all readily available. This area was subdivided about 15 years ago and shows its greatest period of development during following 5 years. Since its initial activity growth has largely depended upon the specialized demand of those seeking this particular type of neighborhood. The area is characterized by tis winding paved streets with steep grades and confusing locations. Construction and maintenance, while of excellent quality, is exceedingly expensive owing to excessive costs below the sill lines. Architectural designs are generally pleasing and the area is not without charm. Mortgage institutions limit their financing to high margin loans. Size and topography of individual sites govern lot prices. There is a high percentage of home ownership; however, owing to the very limited market forced sales are likely to be made on a basis far below reproduction costs. It can readily be seen that the future of an area such as described is clouded with doubt and it is felt that while it has many of the characteristics of a first grade area, owing to hazards mentioned and risks involved, it should not be accorded better than a “medial blue” grade.","9":"Hollywoodland 2nd B-68 2-23-39","10":"","71":"7-1938","72":"52.7","1a":"Slowly N/A N/A","1b":"Professional and business men, motion picture executives and artists, capitalists, etc. Income $5000 and upward","1c":"0 -","1d":"0","1e":"Remote","2a":"7-9 room N/A","2b":"Frame, stucco, brick and stone N/A","2c":"12 years N/A","2d":"Good N/A","2e":"99% N/A","2f":"95% N/A","2g":"6000-11500 N/A","2h":"7000-13500 N/A N/A N/A","2i":"1939 7000-13500 N/A N/A N/A","2j":"Poor to fair N/A","2k":"Static N/A","2l":"Not a rental neighborhood N/A","2m":"N/A N/A N/A N/A","2n":"N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A","2o":"Good N/A","2p":"Variable N/A","4a":"1","4b":"Many","5a":"0","5b":"Many"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-118.318681,34.119646],[-118.318722,34.119038],[-118.319378,34.11879],[-118.319577,34.118306],[-118.319577,34.116676],[-118.31982,34.116204],[-118.320404,34.115803],[-118.320433,34.114504],[-118.32019,34.113465],[-118.317196,34.113182],[-118.31624,34.113158],[-118.316811,34.11193],[-118.316968,34.111517],[-118.317124,34.111104],[-118.316882,34.109604],[-118.316254,34.108034],[-118.31537,34.10742],[-118.313901,34.107089],[-118.313242,34.106961],[-118.313204,34.106064],[-118.322026,34.105702],[-118.327728,34.105566],[-118.327975,34.112902],[-118.329287,34.11339],[-118.329534,34.113816],[-118.329687,34.115185],[-118.329416,34.116133],[-118.328779,34.116758],[-118.328249,34.116904],[-118.327966,34.117021],[-118.327542,34.117197],[-118.32779,34.117782],[-118.328072,34.117929],[-118.328072,34.118309],[-118.327825,34.118455],[-118.327295,34.118514],[-118.326941,34.118748],[-118.326765,34.119275],[-118.326482,34.119333],[-118.325987,34.119392],[-118.325313,34.11966],[-118.324715,34.119099],[-118.324432,34.118602],[-118.323972,34.118426],[-118.323796,34.118485],[-118.32376,34.118953],[-118.323442,34.119392],[-118.323018,34.119596],[-118.318681,34.119646]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B69","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"0":"Los Angeles County","2":"85 N/A","3":"125 5-7 rooms $5500-8000 Moderately","5":"3","6":"Ample","8":"Terrain: Level to hillside slopes in southern portion with northern part much more rugged and with many construction hazards.

This area has been subdivided at various intervals during the past 25 years, and growth has been slow. In the past few years, under stimulus of FHA Title II financing, activity has increased considerably. There are some seven hills within the area and improvements are scattered in groups of 10 or more dwellings throughout. The smaller dwellings are usually in the valleys while the more imposing structures occupy the hillside view locations. While some of the improvements are old they are generally of good quality construction with satisfactory maintenance. Population varies greatly and there is very little cohesion between the various small settlements. The area is adjacent to two street car lines, and bus service is also available. Numerous arterials permit quick (10 minute) auto transportation to Los Angeles Civic Center. Climatic conditions are favorable and topography lends itself to view location homesites. With its many favorable influences, and absence of detrimental factors, the area seems ideal for intelligent development. However, present scattered improvements and seemingly favorable possibilities, the area is accorded a provisional hatched “low blue” grade.","9":"Mt.

The western portion from 6th St. and north part from San Marino Ave. were subdivided and is well built up with moderate sized bungalows. The southeast section south of San Marion Ave. and east of 6th St. is the most choice part of area and was put on the market about 10 years ago but developed very slowly until 1937, but has grown rapidly since that time. This is a highly regarded district and, although it is inclined to be heterogeneous both as to population and improvements, it is considered as being still desirable as a place to live. Maintenance, while somewhat spotted, generally indicates pride of occupancy. Owing to its favorable location this is a good rental area. As a consequence a number of small multi-family structures have been built in the western section of area. In 5 years or such a matter this area will probably have to be broken down and part of it given a 3rd grade classification.

The area consists of a series of hills and valleys, and improvements on the hillside and top are of better grade and more expensive construction than those in the valleys. Hillside lot values are also higher. These factors account for the wide price spread shown above. Desirability shades off from west to east. Adjacent to the green areas to the north and west are favorable influences. Some of the older structures are over 10 years of age and construction is not of as good quality as later improvements.

This is a typical “company” community, largely owned and control by the Standard Oil Co. of California, which is noted for its employee relation policies.

Originally, dwellings were largely built and owned by the company but, consistent with the policy of encouraging employees to live near its industrial activities, home ownership has gradually increased. The community suffered but little from “depression ills”, nor has it been greatly influenced by past depression building activity, although it is approved territory for FHA financing. The business district, which contains many establishments owned by nationally known concerns, is a model for neatness and upkeep. Improvements are very generally 4 to 6 room dwellings of good standard construction with high quality maintenance. Architectural designs are pleasing and population is homogeneous.

This large far flung district varies in age from 25 years or more between Slauson and Florence Avenues to new development from Imperial Highway to Los Angeles County line. There are many old structures scattered throughout which give the area a spotted and heterogeneous aspect. There are many blocks, however, which are uniform as to southwestern part where pattern has not been definitely established. There were many foreclosures in this area during the depression period and the HOLC Veterans’ Welfare Board and other large mortgage institutions at one time owned a large amount of acquirements. These have now, however, been largely liquidated. The area is predominantly workingman’s district and there are numerous duplexes, four family flats and bungalow courts scattered throughout. There is a threat of subversive racial infiltration (Negroes largely) in the southeast portion of area. An attempt was made to break this area down, but it is in a transition period at present, and it was not feasible. However, it is believed that in the course of time it will be necessary that this be done and will result in a number of areas grading from “low blue” to 4th grade. A large amount of FHA financing has recently taken place in the area and has had the effect of greatly increasing home ownership and strengthening its grade. Much of the southwest portion of the area occupies County territory which further confuses the situation. Construction ranges from low to good standard quality. Maintenance is generally fair. Both population and improvements, however, are heterogeneous. There are no major detrimental influences, and taken by and large the area will grade “low yellow” throughout.","9":"South 3rd - C-140 3/14/39","10":"","71":"1937-8","72":"County - 52.70 City 15.10","1a":"Moderately N/A N/A","1b":"Predominantly factory workers, some artisans and WPA workers Income $700-$1500 and up","1c":"10 Italians, not subversive","1d":"0","1e":"No evidence at present.","2a":"4 and 5 rooms Multi-family 10%","2b":"Frame and stucco Larger dwellings 5%","2c":"15 years N/A","2d":"Fair N/A","2e":"97% N/A","2f":"40% N/A","2g":"1800-3000 N/A","2h":"2250-3500 N/A N/A N/A","2i":"1939 2250-3500 N/A N/A N/A","2j":"Fair N/A","2k":"Static N/A","2l":"20-30 N/A","2m":"20-35 N/A N/A N/A","2n":"1939 20-35 N/A N/A N/A","2o":"Good N/A","2p":"Static N/A","4a":"6","4b":"Few","5a":"85","5b":"Many"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-118.223011,33.981543],[-118.218825,33.981603],[-118.217292,33.981101],[-118.206383,33.979918],[-118.206205,33.975897],[-118.203673,33.975927],[-118.203459,33.974212],[-118.202746,33.971965],[-118.201071,33.969334],[-118.197113,33.965549],[-118.195333,33.964177],[-118.192837,33.961604],[-118.195225,33.961868],[-118.196258,33.961978],[-118.203914,33.968368],[-118.209886,33.969058],[-118.20947,33.972138],[-118.215857,33.97305],[-118.217583,33.972898],[-118.225331,33.973943],[-118.23024,33.974376],[-118.230242,33.97477],[-118.23042,33.98928],[-118.22742,33.989248],[-118.227384,33.975146],[-118.222928,33.974821],[-118.223011,33.981543]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C141","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"0":"Los Angeles County","2":"85 N/A","3":"35 5 and 6 room $4250-$5500 Owner built","5":"3","6":"Ample","8":"Terrain: Level, no construction hazards.

Conveniences are generally all readily available. This is one of the older parts of Los Angeles and has been developed in a very haphazard manner. It is so extremely spotted that it is impossible to describe the area and present a clear picture of it. Construction ranges from standard to substandard with some “Jerry building”. Maintenance in general is fair with pride of occupancy being indicated in many instances. There is a wide spread in age of improvements, old and new dwellings being mixed throughout and in some districts spotted with residential income properties. Obsolescence is observed in most parts of the area. North and west of Occidental College and adjacent to it is a small district of large old dwellings of more imposing character, but age and obsolescence preclude a higher grade than that assigned to the area as a whole. Location, accessibility and proximity to Occidental College are favorable influences. Taking it all in all the chief characteristic of this nondescript area is heterogeneity, and this applies alike to population, improvements, terrain and state of repair. The area is a large one and in time some of the districts, which are least improved at present, may rate a higher grade.

While this district has been “definitely declining” for a number of years the process has been a very gradual one and present indications are that this trend will continue indefinitely.

This is a new subdivision recently placed on the market by the Huntington Land and Improvement Co., who originally purchased it for a short interurban route from Pasadena to Los Angeles. This route was discarded and it lay dormant as a swampy tract until it was included in a WPA project, cleared and drained. (How this was accomplished was not researched). After this improvement the area was platted and placed upon the market as a high grade “commuters” subdivision. Under the stimulus of promotional effort and FHA Title II financing, great progress has been made in its development. Construction runs from standard or better grade. Architectural designs are individually attractive and harmonious as a whole. Population bids fair to be homogeneous. Owing to the convenience of the location to the new Los Angeles City Civic Center the area is a popular one City, County, State and Federal employees.

No construction hazards. Land improved 50%. Deed restrictions designate types of improvements, provide uniform setbacks, and protection from subversive racial elements. Conveniences are all reasonably and readily available. Some dead end streets. Many poorly and cheaply constructed street improvements. Part of this district was originally subdivided a number of years ago, but was far from successful. During the past 4 years under the stimulus of FHA Title I and Title II financing a number of speculative builders have operated in the area and it has been considered one of the community “hot spots”. Constructive ranges from substandard to standard quality. Architectural designs are individually attractive and usually harmonious as a whole. Population is inclined to be heterogeneous, and while owner occupancy is high, equities average so low as to threaten the economic stability of the area. Practically all improvements are being constructed by speculative builders whose profits are said to be largely derived from arbitrary increase in land prices. Sales are being effected by “high pressure” methods and there is evidence of increasing sales resistance, as many completed dwellings remain unsold. The section east of San Gabriel Blvd. appears to be the most promising part of the area. The section lying north of Chestnut Ave. west of Del Mar St., known as San Gabriel Village, adjoins a low-grade Mexican section and is engulfed by it on three sides and in addition is in proximity to the Pasadena Sewer Farm. This ambitious project is sponsored by Percy Bilton, Inc., which is aid to be financed with English capital. Informed sources very generally consider this a misplaced investment that is doomed to failure. Although most of the improvements are new and fairly well constructed, when the location, character of population, lack of appeal, and large number of completed dwellings remaining unsold are taken into consideration, it is not deemed wise to assign to the are higher than a “medial yellow” grade.","9":"San Gabriel Village and So.

The few subversive racial elements in the city are confined and scattered throughout that portion of city shown as the business district and so zoned.","9":"Sierra Madre 3rd C-41 4/28/39","10":"","71":"7-1938","72":"61.4","1a":"Slowly N/A N/A","1b":"Business and professional men, white-collar workers, retired people, laborers, etc. Income $1200-$2500 and up","1c":"Few None subversive","1d":"0","1e":"None apparent","2a":"5-6 room Large old 15%","2b":"Frame and stucco Multi-family 5%","2c":"25 years N/A","2d":"Fair to good N/A","2e":"97% N/A","2f":"65% N/A","2g":"2250-4500 N/A","2h":"2500-4500 N/A N/A N/A","2i":"1939 2500-5000 N/A N/A N/A","2j":"Poor to fair N/A","2k":"Static N/A","2l":"25-35 N/A","2m":"25-40 N/A N/A N/A","2n":"1939 25-40 N/A N/A N/A","2o":"Good N/A","2p":"Static N/A","4a":"0","4b":"Few","5a":"0","5b":"Few"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-118.011553,34.151167],[-118.011481,34.148964],[-118.009746,34.149023],[-118.009746,34.150881],[-118.004244,34.150911],[-118.000893,34.150911],[-118.001,34.14917],[-118.003139,34.149141],[-118.003139,34.148078],[-118.002604,34.148019],[-118.001891,34.14799],[-118.001998,34.146544],[-118.005242,34.146426],[-118.005207,34.145423],[-118.003317,34.145393],[-118.003174,34.141528],[-118.003353,34.141056],[-118.008344,34.141056],[-118.009485,34.140967],[-118.009378,34.137367],[-118.009342,34.135862],[-118.01412,34.135774],[-118.01412,34.136718],[-118.014583,34.136836],[-118.015653,34.136807],[-118.015688,34.137958],[-118.017435,34.137987],[-118.017613,34.138282],[-118.017649,34.140436],[-118.015011,34.140436],[-118.015011,34.142885],[-118.020608,34.142856],[-118.020715,34.145718],[-118.012943,34.145748],[-118.013052,34.151156],[-118.011553,34.151167]]],[[[-117.986858,34.152642],[-117.986382,34.15213],[-117.986311,34.150006],[-117.986406,34.148],[-117.986454,34.146879],[-117.990637,34.146938],[-117.990637,34.145895],[-117.995628,34.145836],[-117.998599,34.145836],[-117.99993,34.145836],[-117.999859,34.146879],[-117.996555,34.146957],[-117.996436,34.147213],[-117.996436,34.148157],[-117.996745,34.148216],[-117.998813,34.148197],[-117.998789,34.14916],[-117.996603,34.149219],[-117.996603,34.150616],[-117.996816,34.150714],[-117.997506,34.150714],[-117.997506,34.152091],[-117.997601,34.15217],[-118.003162,34.15213],[-118.003115,34.152799],[-118.001095,34.152858],[-118.001095,34.154255],[-118.0005,34.154294],[-118.000548,34.156989],[-117.999692,34.157028],[-117.999669,34.159939],[-117.996793,34.160037],[-117.994083,34.16102],[-117.993465,34.161001],[-117.991992,34.158582],[-117.992538,34.157048],[-117.991873,34.156753],[-117.99135,34.156477],[-117.990494,34.156104],[-117.98719,34.155986],[-117.987024,34.155572],[-117.987,34.152858],[-117.986858,34.152642]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C42","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"0":"Los Angeles County","2":"75 25","3":"50 4-5 room stucco $3250-$4500 Moderately","5":"3","6":"Limited and selective","8":"Level terrain except in northeast where it is sloping to hillside. 50% developed.

While the future of areas of this character is usually clouded, it is felt safe to accord this area a “medial yellow” grade.","9":"Claremont 3rd C-56 5/8/39","10":"","71":"8/9","72":"49.3","1a":"Moderately N/A N/A","1b":"White collar workers, artisans and laborers.

Land improved 30% of the 60% available for building sites. There are no deeds restrictions nor zoning; however, are terrain and isolation protective elements. Transportation limited to private automobiles. Free bus service to public schools. Churches, trading and amusement centers are remote, the nearest being Westwood Village. Originally opened up some 14 or 16 years ago as a small “cabin” type project. This area has improved considerably in the past few years and new construction is now more pretentious and of much better quality. In consequence the area is extremely heterogeneous, improvements varying from two-room cabins and shacks to new modern 6 and 7 room bungalows. There are very few improved streets and the majority shown on the map are non-existent and are topographically impossible. Platting has been largely arbitrary, contours being followed as improvements were made. In this respect lack of restrictions has been a decided detriment. Beverly Glen Blvd., the principal thoroughfare, is a through trunk highway, and well-traveled, but is narrow and winding with a number of steep grades. Lot values run from $500 to $650. Realtors state that competition of FHA Title I financing has adversely affected both price and rental values. This area, in common with other canyon developments, faces the hazards of fire, floods and steep grades. Ample forestation, coupled with rustic scenic beauty, lend charm to the neighborhood. These natural advantages, together with prospect of a favorable development of adjacent mountainous section, constitute elements distinctly favorable to the future of the area.

While there has been building activity since the advent of FHA financing, the area is definitely declining and, as more attractive locations of similar character are now available, it is not believed that a grade higher than “medial yellow” is warranted.","9":"East Hollywood 3rd C-90 3/1/39","10":"","71":"8-1939","72":"52.7","1a":"Slowly N/A N/A","1b":"Skilled artisans, white-collar workers, civic employees, etc. Income $1200 to $2500","1c":"5 Italians and Jews","1d":"None known","1e":"Infiltration of Japanese and Negroes is a threat","2a":"5 and 6 rooms Larger dwellings 10%","2b":"Frame ands stucco Multi-family 5%","2c":"17 years N/A","2d":"Fair N/A","2e":"96% N/A","2f":"40% N/A","2g":"3000-3800 N/A","2h":"3300-4200 N/A N/A N/A","2i":"1939 3000-3800 N/A N/A N/A","2j":"Poor N/A","2k":"Downward N/A","2l":"25-35 N/A","2m":"27.50-38.50 10 N/A N/A","2n":"1939 25-35 10 N/A N/A","2o":"Poor N/A","2p":"Downward N/A","4a":"0","4b":"Many","5a":"1","5b":"Many"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-118.243772,34.095041],[-118.244271,34.094509],[-118.243439,34.093919],[-118.242964,34.093486],[-118.244913,34.092128],[-118.243558,34.091636],[-118.242988,34.089608],[-118.244651,34.088486],[-118.248288,34.08577],[-118.248454,34.083821],[-118.251211,34.080947],[-118.251425,34.080061],[-118.250308,34.076222],[-118.250928,34.075038],[-118.254924,34.076607],[-118.253384,34.079033],[-118.259868,34.081946],[-118.259868,34.081938],[-118.260096,34.078985],[-118.261503,34.078702],[-118.263165,34.078492],[-118.26599,34.078135],[-118.265994,34.078137],[-118.270155,34.080576],[-118.271999,34.082277],[-118.272913,34.083712],[-118.272923,34.083727],[-118.270844,34.086911],[-118.270392,34.086695],[-118.269964,34.086892],[-118.269299,34.086892],[-118.267944,34.089195],[-118.267372,34.08896],[-118.265496,34.088191],[-118.263357,34.087266],[-118.263247,34.087221],[-118.25877,34.085415],[-118.258766,34.085422],[-118.256012,34.089923],[-118.252542,34.095769],[-118.253588,34.095848],[-118.250641,34.099961],[-118.250627,34.099954],[-118.248716,34.099016],[-118.246315,34.097107],[-118.243772,34.095041]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C91","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"0":"Los Angeles County","2":"90 N/A","3":"60 5 rooms $4000 Moderately","5":"3","6":"Ample","8":"Terrain: Rolling to steep hillside.

Owing to its very favorable location, when deed restrictions began to expire some 10 years ago, multi-family structures began to appear. The transition from an exclusive single-family neighborhood to a residential income district is proceeding in such an orderly manner and the new structures are so nearly in keeping with the neighborhood that there has been a minimum disturbance of single-family residential values. These multiple housing structures are said to be the most uniform and well-built in the city. The area is surrounded by major arterials upon which outlying business establishments are located.
