The development is filled-in land with sand pumped from the lake and is owned by the Board of Levee Commiussioners of Orleans Levee District. The board has spend approximately twenty million dollars in the development of the Lakeshore area, consisting of sea-wall for about 7 miles along the lake, a four lane paved driveway along lake front, several bridges over canals and bayous, planting of trees and shurbbery and other permanent improvements. The entire development finally completed will provide between 6000 and 7000 building lots and Lake Vista is only a small part. However, the land on both sides, East and West, is a part of the same development program and it is anticipated that when other portions of the development are placed on the market they will have restrictions that will insure a development in accord with that proposed in Lake Vista.

There are several large apartment houses in the area in the price range from $35,000 to $100,000 with a rental range from $45 to $150 per unit. No sales demand at asking prices for apartments but they are well rented.     Along St. Charles Ave. are many large, expensive homes with beautiful gardens and grounds, some costing in excess of $100,000, and because of their high price, type of ownership and manner of maintenance there is very little likelihood of a change into apartments or rooming houses within the near future. After leaving St. Charles Ave. properties are not as expensive but residential desirability is excellent. State St., 3 blocks on either side of St. Charles Ave. contains many beautiful, expensive homes, and it is in this stretch that a home costing about $50,000 has been recently built. Cheaper properties are located on the northern 3 blocks of Joseph St. fronting the schools, and also in the southern portion of the entire area.

At the corner of Jefferson and St. Charles Ave. is a Jewish Children's Home and joining it to the east is Gilbert Academy, a negro school. However, both of these institutions have been in this location longer than the surrounding homes so apparently they have had no detrimental influence.

The predominant type of single and double cottages were built many years ago. Esplanade Avenue, which almost splits the area, was at one time the real residential street of the city and for this reason the area was very popular. This is evidenced by the manner in which the properties have been maintained and the popularity of the section as a residential neighborhood by older citizens. Proximity to City Park and easy access to principal business center are also stabilizing influences. Transportation is by street car along Dumaine and gasoline bus along Esplanade and is adequate.     Along Bayou St. John from DeSoto to Esplanade are located some large old homes, one of which is 140 years olf. These homes are surrounded by brick walls and iron fences, have large grounds which contain beautiful gardens, and overlook the Bayou which has recently been cleaned out and beautified. These old homes are occupied by some of the more substantial citizens of the city.     Near the northern part of the area on the northeast side of Esplanade is a small community on Verna and Leda Streets which is improved with modern single family residences of good construction, well maintained and evidencing pride of ownership.

Residents of the area are employed in shops of Southern Pacific Railway, Algiers Naval Station and Todd Engineering and Dry Dock Company, all of which are located within walking distance. The Naval Station has recently been reopened, not to its former extent, but sufficient to benefit the area.     Sidewalks paved and streets gravel. Area about 70% improved. Location across river limits possibilities of sales and rentals to a large extent to those earning their livelihood in Algiers, or old residents of it.     Conveyance records for 1937 show only 1 sale in this area, a single cottage by a Homestead Association for $2500; for 1938, 2 vacant lots, one at $10 per front foot and one at about $20 per front foot, and two single family houses by HOLC.","9":"Algiers, New Orleans, La. 3rd C-26 1/23/1939","10":"","71":"9","72":"39.75","1a":"Slowly  ","1b":"Railraod shop employees and naval station employees and Todd Dry Dock Company employees","1c":"0 -","1d":"0","1e":"None","2a":"1 story singles 4-5 rms 1 story double cottages 4-5 rms per side","2b":"Frame Frame","2c":"12 yrs. 12 yrs.","2d":"Fair Fair","2e":"95% 95%","2f":"70% 60%","2g":"3000-3500 2000-3500","2h":"3000-4000 (+)6 2000-4000 (+)6","2i":"Jan '39 3000-4000 0 2000-4000 0","2j":"To $3500     Poor To $3000     Poor","2k":"Steady Steady","2l":"20-25 15-18","2m":"20-30 (+)6 15-20 (+)6","2n":"Jan '39 20-30 0 15-20 0","2o":"To $25     Good To $20     Good","2p":"Steady Steady","4a":"1","4b":"-","5a":"2","5b":"1"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-90.051986,29.948566],[-90.052889,29.949637],[-90.053341,29.94939],[-90.055123,29.951367],[-90.052728,29.952977],[-90.053426,29.953657],[-90.052129,29.954349],[-90.05143,29.954522],[-90.048754,29.954596],[-90.048754,29.954435],[-90.046686,29.954435],[-90.046876,29.952561],[-90.04854,29.952685],[-90.048801,29.949431],[-90.047066,29.949369],[-90.047304,29.947063],[-90.050679,29.947269],[-90.050893,29.948628],[-90.051986,29.948566]]]]},"properties":{"name":"Algiers","holc_id":"C27","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"60 40","3":" None -","5":"2, (1937-1938)","6":"Ample","8":"This area is part of the older part of Algiers, occupied by some very substantial citizens including one city commissioner, some bldg. and loan executives, etc. Streets are all paved and majority of properties fairly well maintained.

The greatest detrimental influence to this section of the area is the fact that type of soil is such that foundations in many houses have either slipped or sunk and it has been necessary in some cases to put in new foundations. This same condition is prevalent in almost the entire western part of this area and has acted as a deterrent to new construction, because of the larger expense involved in getting a proper foundation. However, this is to some extent offset by proximity to Lake Pontchartrain and its recreational features, and the fact that during the summer season it is somewhat cooler here. Milne Street has small drainage ditch down the center of the street for its full length and this has restricted development on this particular street because of lack of street crossings over the ditch. Other streets on the western side of the area have fairly uniform construction. Harrison Ave. is sparsely developed.     The extreme eastern side of this area is Memphis St. Which is vacant at Harrison Ave. but between French and Polk has some development of single homes averaging     (Continued on next page)     about 8 years of age and not well maintained.     The entire area has all utilities, paved sidewalks and gravel streets except West End Blvd. on which the pavement has buckled almost the entire length of street because of sinking soil condition.

It is very close to the principal business section, has all utilities, schools, churches and stores are scattered throughout the area. On Burgundy, Dauphine and Bourbon Streets from St. Ann to the eastern boundary of the area, the properties are single and double cottages, most of them of the box step type, some of them badly in need of repair. From St. Ann to the western boundary of the area on the streets mentioned, the properties are 2 and 3 story old brick buildings with commercial establishments on the ground floor and roaming houses and apartments on the upper floors. On Royal Street 95% of the properties are old 2 and 3 story brick buildings, the first floors being occupied by antique shops and in the last 2 blocks toward the eastern side are found second-hand stores for various mercahndise, furniture repair shops, etc. The 2nd and 3rd floors of these buildings are likewise used for rooming houses and apartments. The negro population in this area is mostly found on Burgundy, Dauphine and Bourbon, from St. Ann to the western area, and likewise on the on the intersecting streets, the population is very, very mixed, this part of the area including the major tenderloin section of the City, both colored and white, and while there are some few decent families living in this (Continued on next page) part of the area they are very much in the minority. Royal Street from a residential standpoint is the best street in the area and several of the old brick buildings have been remodeled and the upper floors made into modern apartments which are occupied by people of good reputation. This remodeling program is continuing and indications are that the type of occupants in the area is being improved, in that the agencies managing the properties are making an effort to rent to tenants of a better type than heretofore occupied the area.     Conveyance records for 1937 show 25 sales of improved parcels with prices indicated from $1034 to $13,000, and including 13 stores and combination stores and dwellings or rooming houses or apartments, and 12 single dwellings and cottages; for 1938, sales of 24 improved parcels with prices indicated from $1400 to $12,000 and including 11 combination stores and living quarters, 5 double cottages, 1 duplex and 7 single dwellings and cottages.     Southeast of this area, D-10, is shown a commercial district and while it is given this classification, it is more or less of the same character as Royal Street, that is, the great majority of the properties are 2 and 3 story old brick buildings with the ground floors being used for commercial purposes and the 2nd and 3rd floors beign used for rooming houses and apartments. However, the close proximity to the river and the warehouses located along it, together with some larger commercial enterprises extending on some streets as far as 2 blocks from the river, makes this section predominantly commercial, and is the reason for this classifying it. Attention is called to one particular part of this section which is the block on St. Peter Street between Chartres and Decatur Streets and the block on St. Ann Street between the same 2 streets. These 2 blocks are located on the west and east side respectively of what is called \"Jackson Square\", a vacant square of ground with a monument to General Andrew Jackson located in the center and the plot beautified by shrubbery and trees. The 2 blocks mentioned contain what is called the Pontalba Buildings, they being twin edifices, one located at St. Peter and the other on St. Ann Street and both facing Jackson Square. Thes are large 3 story apartment buildings which were originally built about 1846. They are now owned by the State and within the past 3 years the interiors have been remodeled and made into modern apartments, while the exterior of the buildings have been allowed to remain as originally built.     The \"French Quarter\" of the city is a very historical section, it being the original site of New Orleans, and every effort is now being made to preserve the antiquity of the buildings located in this section insofar as possible. The City has recently named an inspector who is to pass on all applications for remodeling and reconditioning and unless the plans for such work are in keeping with the idea of retaining the antique architecture, building permits are not issued for the work. However, every real estate broker interviewed was emphatic in his statement that there was a demand for properties located in the \"French Quarter\" and while none of them could offer an explanation for the reason for the demand, they all said they had no difficulty in making sales in the \"Quarter\", probably one reason for this is that the properties are old, many of them badly in need or repair, they can be bought for reasonable prices and after spending additional money to remodel and modernize them into apartments they can be rented and a good return received on the total investment. Rental demand for modern apartments in the area is high and many brokers report a waiting list for such units.     One broker stated that a movement was now on foot by several prominent citizens whereby plans were being formulated to obtain approval of the section for insured mortgages.     It is difficult for an outsider to realize why this section should be in demand from a residential standpoint. All the buildings probably range in age from 50 years up, streets are very narrow and present population is largely of the undesirable element, but the fact remains that there are people in New Orleans of the highest type who prefer to live in the \"French Quarter\" and are willing to pay good rents; it has the advantage of being very close to the principal business section and this section is replete with history. It is a mecca for tourists, for in the section are located the historical St. Louis Cathedral, the Cabildo (a state museum) and many other spots of historical interest.","9":"New Orleans, La 4th D-10 2/6/1939","10":" ","71":"9","72":"39.75","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Low class negro and white loafers, laborers, mechanics and also some much higher class professional, clerical & executives","1c":"10 Italian - French","1d":"60","1e":"None","2a":"Single and double cottages 4-5 rms 2 & 3 story combination Com'l & Apts. & Rooms","2b":"Frame Brick","2c":"50 yrs. 70 yrs,","2d":"Poor Poor to fair","2e":"95% 80%","2f":"10% 5%","2g":"2000-3500 4000-8000","2h":"2000-4000 (+)6 4000-10,000 (+)6","2i":"Jan '39 2000-4000 0 4000-10,000 0","2j":"Fair Fair - Good on Royal Street","2k":"Firm Firm to upward","2l":"12-25 20-50","2m":"12-25 0 20-60 (+)6","2n":"Jan '39 12-25 0 20-60 0","2o":"Fair Good for apt units","2p":"Steady Firm to upward","4a":"3","4b":"--","5a":"1","5b":"13"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-90.067051,29.993276],[-90.069333,29.991804],[-90.07127,29.990631],[-90.077402,29.992679],[-90.083449,29.992483],[-90.083924,29.997486],[-90.080335,29.99765],[-90.082058,30.000655],[-90.075047,30.001047],[-90.075855,30.000306],[-90.067051,29.993276]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"D11","holc_grade":"D","area_description_data":{"2":"90 10","3":"6 Singles $3000-4500 Moderately","5":"2, (1937-1938)","6":"Very limited","8":"The prices on buildings shown above are very largely applicable to the properties west of Paris Ave., which is the worst part of area, and prices east of Paris Ave. will range approximately 20% higher, both values and rents.

This tract is owned by one man who has built a beautiful home costing about $30,000 situated on a tract at the northwest corner fronting about 200 ft. on Mirabeau and extending back about the same distance along London Ave. Instead of being a street at this point, London Ave. is an open drainage canal which, however, does not carry drainage water. The beginning of the canal is approximately at the corner of Humanity St. 1 block south of Gentilly Rd., where a pumping station is located, and extending north to Lake Pontchartrain. It was said this party intended to develop 2 sub-divisions in this area, one in the higher price bracket and one in the medium, and that he was now making efforts to procure financing for these developments and the near future would probably see its beginning.","9":"New Orleans, La., Gentilly 4th D-12 2/4/1939","10":" ","71":"9","72":"39.75","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Low income negro mechanics, laborers, WPA workers.","1c":"0 -","1d":"90","1e":"None","2a":"Single cottages 3-5 rms ","2b":"Frame ","2c":"15 yrs.

That part south of railroad tracks is located on both sides of a small canal and some of the houses are shacks. That part on the north side of railroad tracks is on Sala Avenue, the south end of which is commercial, and properties here are better than in other part of area. Westwego is a separate municipality with all utilities except sewerage. Some properties in southern part of this area do not have plumbing fixtures and toilets are located in back yards.     Proximity of industrial plants is favorable to the area from the standpoint of providing employment to residents. Small canal in southern part of area used as parking place for fishing boats and other small craft. Walnut Street ferry docks at Sala Avenue and provides easy access to New Orleans proper. Gasoline bus runs from Westwego to Algiers which gives an additional entry to New Orleans by way of Canal Street ferry.     Schools, churches and stores are convenient. Sala Street is paved and other streets are not paved. Sidewalks are paved.     Conveyance records indicate 1 sale in 1938, an improved property for $2500.     Total tax rate is somewhat higher, but assessments are low, averaging about 30-40%.     (Continued on next page)     On April 1, 1937 Westwego first defaulted on interest on its outstanding bonds, which were $69,000 water works bonds and $175,000 paving bonds, or a total of $244,000. These issues were refunded on September 1, 1937 by a like amount of bonds at same coupon rate. Real estate taxes collected from industrial plants formerly made up the larger portion of the town's income, and due to the dismantling of these plants and their removal to other locations this income has greatly declined. Assessments on 8 industries in 1929 was $2,088,847, which declined to $391,290 in 1937, or about 18% of 1929 assessments. Total assessments in 1926 were $3,322,252, which in 1938 had declined to an estimated $1,244,807, or about 37% of 1926 assessments. In addition the majority of homes in Westwego are in the low price class and are subject to the homestead exemption.     The building of the Huey P. Long Bridge across the Mississippi River about 2 miles above Westwego, and which was opened in the latter part of 1936, resulted in about all of Westbound traffic using this bridge. Prior to the opening of the bridge most all of this traffic used the Ferry across the river from New Orleans to Westwego, and the loss of this traffic also seriously affected the income of Westwego since they had been receiving a percentage of the Ferry Company revenue and about 90% of this revenue was received from the through traffic either to or from the west.     As a result of this income decrease the town is finding it difficult to meet its obligations and the situation is still serious.","9":"Westwego, Jefferson Parish, New Orleans, La. 4th D-42 2/6/1939","10":"","71":"8","72":"40.25","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Predominately lower class fishermen, factory workers, wage hands.","1c":"0 -","1d":"5","1e":"None","2a":"1 story double cottages 3-4 rms 1 story singles 3-4 rms","2b":"Frame Frame","2c":"25 yrs. 20 yrs.","2d":"Poor Fair","2e":"100% 100%","2f":"30% 40%","2g":"1000-1200 750-1200","2h":"1000-1500 (+)6 750-1500 (+)6","2i":"Jan '39 1000-1500 0 750-1500 0","2j":"Very poor Very poor","2k":"Steady Steady","2l":"8-10 8-12","2m":"8-12 (+)6 8-15 (+)6","2n":"Jan '39 8-12 0 8-15 0","2o":"To $10     Good To $15     Good","2p":"Steady Steady","4a":"0","4b":"--","5a":"0","5b":"--"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-90.106552,29.897304],[-90.108786,29.897201],[-90.108881,29.900889],[-90.106623,29.900827],[-90.106552,29.897304]]],[[[-90.110925,29.899241],[-90.110973,29.897448],[-90.120195,29.898417],[-90.127183,29.89957],[-90.131746,29.90093],[-90.131176,29.902682],[-90.131627,29.902846],[-90.130487,29.905113],[-90.129156,29.904866],[-90.129631,29.903877],[-90.130415,29.902496],[-90.129203,29.902249],[-90.12742,29.901775],[-90.110925,29.899241]]]]},"properties":{"name":"Jefferson Parish","holc_id":"D43","holc_grade":"D","area_description_data":{"2":"80 20","3":" None ","5":"","6":"Limited","8":"This area is a stretch along the main highway mixed with double and single cottages not well maintained as a whole, although those on the highway are the better.
