It was platted by the David C. Bell Investment Company with restrictions as to size of lots and also cost of construction.  The platting was made shortly before the World War and the development was only moderately fast.  During the war and shortly thereafter, many people of the Jewish race, who had acquired wealth during that period, moved in to this section, and Jews comprise almost the entire population of the district.  This district, because of the patronage of one race, has possibly reached its peak both in values, and its desirability which will largely be confined to that race.  Many wealthy Jewish people, during the past ten years, have moved to the southwestern part of Minneapolis desiring to get away from one district which is confined to only members of their own race.  Homes range from $4,500 to $30,000 in value and in age from three to 20 years old, some brick but with frame and stucco predominating.  Some rehabilitation is necessary, particularly in that part easterly from Thomas Avenue to Queen Avenue, bounded on the north by Plymouth south to Eighth Avenue.  The undesirable feature of this neighborhood is the close proximity of the lower class of Jewish people residing immediately adjacent to the east and south of this area, which homes, in many instances are 40 to 50 years old.  Values in A11 depreciated about 40% from 1929 to 1933 with a recovery of about 20% of the drop.  That, however, would pertain only to Jewish purchasers.  The fact that the market in this area is confined largely to Jews, make the section undesirable to others.  This estimate of values would be confined to Jewish transactions.

Buildings are of frame, brick and stucco.  There are many apartments and duplexes; also many single five, six and seven room homes, one, one and one-half and two stories high.  The earliest development of this area was west of Hennepin Avenue to Lake Calhoun.  In this part of the area the homes range in age from 10 to 40 years.  Considerable rehabilitation is needed.  There has been a gradual development of apartments, rooming houses and duplexes.  Several attempts have been made to have the lots fronting the east shore of Lake Calhoun zoned for apartments but at the present time it is a restricted district.  This area, bounded by Lake Street on the north, 36th on the south and Hennepin on the east, is one of the older districts in the city.  Lake Calhoun was the chief reason for its early development.  It has seen its best days, however, as the trend is now to the extreme southern and southwestern parts of the city.  The valuation shrinkage here has been quite heavy, possibly 40%, with very little recovery.  Much rehabilitation is needed in this area.  Lake Calhoun is the influence which makes this a desirable residential section and stabilizes it to some extent.  East from Hennepin Avenue to Lyndale Avenue and south of Lake Street to East 36th Street the development has practically seen its best days but this section remains stable because of its accessibility to the business section of Lake Street and its close proximity to Lake Harriet and Lake Calhoun.  There are many apartments in this section; also, many duplexes.  The type of construction is brick, stucco and frame, mostly single dwellings, one, one and one-half and two stories in height.  Much rehabilitation is needed in this area.  In the balance of the district, east and south, is a newer development of the past 25 years, many homes therein ranging from $4,500 to $10,000.  The area has a owner-occupancy of approximately 85%.  A slow encroachment of negroes on the extreme easterly limits of this area threatens it, but the efforts of the Nicollet Improvement Association, a voluntary organization of property owners in the district, is affording protection against much encroachment."}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-93.321484,44.923453],[-93.318878,44.923425],[-93.318937,44.925088],[-93.316094,44.924711],[-93.315956,44.926836],[-93.313428,44.926864],[-93.314021,44.925983],[-93.312619,44.925438],[-93.311519,44.924635],[-93.311338,44.924503],[-93.311316,44.924487],[-93.311434,44.924319],[-93.3125,44.924557],[-93.312974,44.924068],[-93.314593,44.924333],[-93.315245,44.923257],[-93.315166,44.921411],[-93.317476,44.921481],[-93.317612,44.914233],[-93.315047,44.914198],[-93.314988,44.910662],[-93.316191,44.910728],[-93.316284,44.907101],[-93.317518,44.907101],[-93.317395,44.905265],[-93.308728,44.905168],[-93.308732,44.904977],[-93.308792,44.901453],[-93.31885,44.901391],[-93.318825,44.905194],[-93.32903,44.90531],[-93.328964,44.921607],[-93.328869,44.921606],[-93.318906,44.921542],[-93.318937,44.923289],[-93.32278,44.923298],[-93.325295,44.922886],[-93.325257,44.92336],[-93.328869,44.923603],[-93.328985,44.923611],[-93.328908,44.930568],[-93.328796,44.930569],[-93.323992,44.93061],[-93.323944,44.928747],[-93.321404,44.928727],[-93.321484,44.923453]]],[[[-93.317011,44.935105],[-93.315918,44.935054],[-93.314394,44.935054],[-93.313646,44.934748],[-93.312956,44.934433],[-93.312137,44.934239],[-93.310383,44.934077],[-93.310383,44.933771],[-93.310477,44.933654],[-93.310491,44.933669],[-93.311154,44.933389],[-93.311734,44.933161],[-93.312451,44.932705],[-93.312663,44.932529],[-93.312976,44.932555],[-93.312902,44.933962],[-93.317503,44.934079],[-93.317395,44.934994],[-93.317011,44.935105]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B14","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"1":"This area is a desirable residential section occupied largely by business and professional men.
