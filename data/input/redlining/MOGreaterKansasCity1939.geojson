An encroachment of their gambling operations have adversely affected value during the last four years. The large homes in this area, some of which cost between $100,000 and $200,000, have dropped at least 60% in value since 1929, while the general run of houses costing between $25,000 and $60,000 suffered a 50% shrinkage. A large number of the mansions are on the market at low prices. Despite the fact that the area was begun eighteen years ago and is in some respects is declining, it continues to be the \"gold coast\" of Kansas City and with adjoining Mission Hills is one of the outstanding exclusive residential subdivisions of the United States.

Mr. Dible in his advertisements stresses the fact that his terms are \"less than FHA.\" These new houses can be acquired as low as $100 cash down payment, the balance at $55 per month. Mr. Dible's company, the Home Investment Corporation, takes a second mortgage after the buyer has obtained as large a first mortgage as possible from the savings and loan association or other institution. These terms have attracted a number of buyers to the area. Mr. Dible frankly stated that he would not now be building so many houses were it not for the fact that he was burdened with all the vacant land in this area and in order to \"come out\" he found it necessary to utilize the space.

During the building and financing days, fifteen to eighteen years ago, this first mortgage bond financing was handled largely through Chicago institutions of high repute. All of the apartments in this area are in the better class structures affording all of the comforts of apartment living at very reasonable prices, considered approximately 60% to 70% below the 1929 rent level.

Between these energetic and enterprising builders this area built up rapidly beginning twenty-five years ago. Except for the eastern fringe in the vicinity of Rockhill, it is distinctly a neighborhood of 2-story houses with some Queen Annes, a few bungalows, particularly in the south end and the east end. As a whole these structures were substantially built but the area is now declining. Between Brookside and Rockill, Morningside and 63rd, is Morningside Addition developed by Mr. Cowherd. This is an attractive, uniformly-built area of 2-story houses, largest in B-14. Although the area has retained some of its character, some of which is the distinction of being \"Country Club\", it has experienced sharp decline in values during the alst four years, in fact since 1929. Conversely, should there be a definite upturn in economic conditions locally, this area would undoubtedly display an upturn. The area has a high percentage of vacancies and hosues on the market for sale. Transportation facilities are inadequate in some parts of the area. There is an active business community at Brookside and 63rd, with the Plaza business district not far removed. The area is restricted, has all utilities, and adequate school facilities.

It is a bungalow area, a few 2-story houses fairly substantial in construction. The area is occupied by the \"middle-class\", including white-collar workers and clerks. The vicinity of this area has had a great deal of WPA work which has improved the appearance of that part of the city. Only a fair second-grade area.

Immediately south of 61st St. is \"Countryside\", a recently platted subdivision with six new houses in April 1839 of the larger and better type. This subdivision if it develops will undoubtedly be much better and more exclusive than Mission Hill Acres. The latter is a very spotted section with its wide range in variety and types of houses. The growth of this subdivision has been sufficient to warrant the establishment of a Post Office there, which was authorized in April 1939. While a good many FHA loans have been made in the area there are loans which are not FHA but made by the building and loan associations in Kansas City, Kansas and other points in Kansas, as well as the Federal savings and loan associations of Kansas City, Missouri. The Home Building & Loan Association of Ottowa, Kansas is quite active in this area. Building and loan association loans other than FHA are usually made up to 75% of the market value.","9":"Mission Township Johnson County, Kan Second B-6 2-1-39","10":"","71":"","72":"HOLC LOANS - 1 as of 4-1-40","1a":"Yes  ","1b":"Wage earners, teachers, small business and professional","1c":"0 ","1d":"0","1e":"Above groups","2a":"Singles 4-7 rms ","2b":"Frame 80%, brick & stucco 20% ","2c":"New to 12 years ","2d":"Good ","2e":"99% ","2f":"85% ","2g":"1800-4250 ","2h":"2000-4500 Up 10%  ","2i":"Current 2000-4500   ","2j":"Up to $3750 Fair ","2k":"Static ","2l":"15-50 ","2m":"15-55 Up 10%  ","2n":"Current 15-55   ","2o":"Up to $35 Good ","2p":"Strong ","4a":"1 - $4800","4b":"Very few","5a":"None","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-94.63836,39.022652],[-94.631021,39.022628],[-94.630249,39.022652],[-94.630041,39.018174],[-94.63016,39.016581],[-94.638211,39.016558],[-94.638389,39.016858],[-94.63836,39.022652]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B7","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Kansas City","2":"100 ","3":"5 5 rms $4500 Fair","5":"2","6":"Ample","8":"Mission Highlands, a developement begun by Mission Hill Investment Co., 10 years ago, designed to house an \"average\" class of people.

The area has suffered a severe shrinkage in values, there being very little demand for the large houses upon which the assessed valuation in many cases is twice the fair market value. In the vicinity of Manheim Road is a Jewish district into which moved the leading Jews some thirty years ago. Armour Boulevard in this area has many of the city's largest apartments. Between Oak and Main, 43rd and Armour, are also many apartments. Much of the area is going into rooming houses. the section south of 43rd is restricted only to residential uses, therefore cannot turn to rooming houses which is a detriment to that neighborhood. Gillham Road, running througnh the area, is in a ravine and has been developed into an artistic park largely through WPA labor.

The area is one of the oldest sections in Kansas City, situated on a high bluff overlooking the industrial valley surrounding Kansas River, also Kansas City, Kansas. Fifty years ago Quality Hill was an exclusive section occupied by some of the leading citizens. Its large two-story houses, mostly all brick, have long since been turned into 2-family structures and rooming houses. Typical of such an area they are in very poor repair. About 25% of the structures in the area are apartments varying in size from 4 and 6-family units to 24-units, with 3 or 4 40-unit structures. There is a definitie distinction in the type of property in Reservoir Hill and Quality Hill with West Pennway the dividing line. The south end is a slum section almost entirely of frame single-family houses, most of which have deteriorated to shaacks. This section is occupied by a low class of people, Mexicans and negroes predominating almost entirely. Mexicans are also scattered throughout the Quality Hill section where is also found a very poor type of people throughout including some negroes. There is no market for property in this area. It has the advantage of being close in but is unattractive to the better class of clerks and business sales people because of its surroundings and poor type of citizenry in the area generally. There are business encroachments throughout the area.

Throughout the area are a large number of apartments, particularly along 9th Street, The Paseo and other streets. Many of these are in the colored areas as well as other parts of the districts. There are a number of negro apartments renting at $25 a unit. Otherwise $20 per unit is the maximum. The ratio of assessed value to market value is high.","9":"Kansas City, MO.

The ground is very hilly dropping into a deep hollow at the western extremity. Most of the houses are on large lots, a rather poorly kept neighborhood with a suburban atmospher typical of a fringe district. The area has poor transportation facilities, but utilities and school facilities are adequate . Occupied partly by industrial workers from the plants to the south accessible to this area. There are reasons why this area may pick up, due to location and room for the future development of small type homes.

The neighborhood lacks nothing in the way of schools, utilities and transportation facilities.
