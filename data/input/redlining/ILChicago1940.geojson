Favorable advantages outweigh the disadvantages of distances to amenities, and the section therefore warrants a first-class rating.","9":"Winnetka, Ill. 1st A-15 Jan. 1940","1a":"Steadily  ","1b":"Upper class","1c":"0% ","1d":"0%","1e":"None","2a":"One family 8-14 rooms ","2b":"Brick ","2c":"1-23 years ","2d":"Very good ","2e":"100% ","2f":"90% ","2g":"$22,500 & up ","2h":"$25,000- 75,000 10+  ","2i":"$25,000- 75,000 December 30, 1899  ","2j":"Good- $30,000 ","2k":"Firm ","2l":"$140.00-225.00 ","2m":"$160.00-250.00 12+  ","2n":"$160.00-250.00 December 30, 1899  ","2o":"Good- $200.00 ","2p":"Firm ","4a":"","4b":"","5a":"","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.711106,42.095916],[-87.712112,42.094423],[-87.71285,42.093846],[-87.713277,42.093673],[-87.714513,42.093472],[-87.716028,42.096152],[-87.715057,42.096931],[-87.725032,42.105813],[-87.72702,42.107742],[-87.734231,42.116074],[-87.734865,42.116431],[-87.735477,42.116593],[-87.736809,42.117906],[-87.737531,42.118603],[-87.737902,42.119332],[-87.737815,42.119721],[-87.737793,42.120677],[-87.738164,42.120856],[-87.738732,42.121601],[-87.739038,42.122136],[-87.741386,42.12272],[-87.742091,42.123181],[-87.743007,42.123924],[-87.743007,42.124216],[-87.742963,42.124848],[-87.743159,42.125448],[-87.744051,42.12655],[-87.744362,42.126952],[-87.741348,42.127995],[-87.740547,42.126987],[-87.739848,42.125806],[-87.738644,42.124394],[-87.737245,42.12255],[-87.736274,42.120822],[-87.733866,42.118171],[-87.733361,42.117594],[-87.732856,42.11745],[-87.731729,42.116038],[-87.730486,42.114453],[-87.729904,42.113647],[-87.729049,42.113157],[-87.728583,42.112782],[-87.727612,42.111456],[-87.726874,42.11065],[-87.726602,42.110419],[-87.72598,42.109526],[-87.725514,42.109093],[-87.724815,42.108661],[-87.723688,42.107681],[-87.72093,42.104799],[-87.716579,42.100879],[-87.713005,42.097709],[-87.711024,42.096037],[-87.711106,42.095916]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"A16","holc_grade":"A","area_description_data":{"2":"100% ","3":"January 1, 1900 one family owner built","5":"","6":"$16,000-18,000; Ample & private sources 4 1/2%- 10 years","7":" ","8":"This is all riparian property with the exception of the hosues on Fuller Lane, and the public park library.

Several of the one-family homes are old Chicago landmarks and include such well-known structures as the Potter Palmer Mansion; these will probably be eventually replaced by apartments similar to those now located along the Drive. there aer several vacant parcels of ground which are presently available for such construction, but development of this character is arrested and it is somewhat doubtful that any immediate high-class apartment construction will occur. The street overlooks Lake Michigan, which is a favorable influence; convenience to downtown Chicago is attractive to persons who want an \"in town\" location. Public (over) school attendance is necessarily of a very cosmopolitan character, due to the proximity of the very poor areas lying west of Clark St. An attempt is now being made, however, to secure a public school location east of Dearborn St. and north of Chicago Ave., with a district restriction to confine attendance to only those children living east of Clark. Should this prove successful, it is reasonable to assume that the entire area would be somewhat more appealing to families with youngsters of grade school age. The bulk of the children today go to private schools. Because of the lack of competition in this class of building, and the high-class occupancy, the section is rated first class, although it does not meet any of the requirements of a typical first class residential neighborhood.","9":"Chicago 1st A-34 Mar. 1940","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Upper middle class- upper class","1c":"0% ","1d":"0%","1e":"None","2a":"Apartments- 4-15 rooms ","2b":"Brick ","2c":"15-25 years ","2d":"Good ","2e":"90% in large units; 97% in small units ","2f":" ","2g":" ","2h":"   ","2i":" December 30, 1899  ","2j":" ","2k":" ","2l":" ","2m":"$27.50-35.00 a room- large units; $40.00-45.00 a room- small units 20+  ","2n":"Good- small units 10-  ","2o":"Firm ","2p":" ","4a":"","4b":"","5a":"","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.674611,41.729902],[-87.682383,41.729822],[-87.682348,41.731179],[-87.677963,41.731285],[-87.678105,41.733999],[-87.675681,41.734505],[-87.676572,41.735542],[-87.675396,41.735436],[-87.67208,41.732882],[-87.672936,41.732403],[-87.673328,41.731578],[-87.673328,41.731285],[-87.671937,41.729955],[-87.674611,41.729902]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"A35","holc_grade":"A","area_description_data":{"2":"100% ","3":"December 30, 1899  ","5":"","6":"Ample 5%","7":" See Tax Rates page 4","8":"This area is known as the most exclusive part of Beverley Hills.

A high degree of pride of home ownership is evident in well-kept lawns, shrubs, etc. It is well timbered. There is little turnover of property, as these old families have no desire to sell and are quite able to hold and live in these old homesteads. The area will be good for many years and is very exclusive. People living here pride themselves as being one of the original families of Beverley Hills. It is retricted to residences and well buffered by the forest preserve on the north, and the Rock Island Suburban to the east. It is interesting to note that many of these old buildings are now being modernized on a big scale. Vacant property has doubled in value since 1935. Ground values are substantially higher than residential values, and will remain at a peak for some time. Well-informed realtors are of the opinion that this area will always remain one of the high-grade districts in Beverley Hills. It is spotted as to class of homes, composed of frames, stucco and brick. A substantial business district is at 95th and the Rock Island depot. On the west side of Vanderpool are some high-grade new brick residences of 2 stories. Due to its location and class of home-owning residents, it is believed by realtors that these old homes will all be modernized or, where necessary, replaced by better ones; and that the area will continue improving, notwithstanding its age.","9":"Beverley Hills A- February 5, 1900 November 1, 1939","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Business and Professional","1c":"December 30, 1899 ","1d":"December 30, 1899","1e":"None","2a":"Single; 6-19 rooms 1-3 storys ","2b":"Brick and frame ","2c":"25 years ","2d":"Good ","2e":"December 31, 1899 ","2f":"December 31, 1899 ","2g":"$9,00-16,000 ","2h":"$11,000-20,000   ","2i":"(1939) $11,000-20,000   ","2j":"Static ","2k":"Static ","2l":"Not a ","2m":"Rent   ","2n":"Area   ","2o":" ","2p":" ","4a":"","4b":"","5a":"December 31, 1899","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.767475,42.16523],[-87.770854,42.165403],[-87.771146,42.165057],[-87.772661,42.165489],[-87.77674,42.165511],[-87.77674,42.167821],[-87.777439,42.167756],[-87.778196,42.167756],[-87.778954,42.168296],[-87.777264,42.171039],[-87.781809,42.176501],[-87.781401,42.177063],[-87.781343,42.177883],[-87.783994,42.181424],[-87.785116,42.181834],[-87.785873,42.182935],[-87.785931,42.183367],[-87.786077,42.183928],[-87.786398,42.184166],[-87.78765,42.184965],[-87.788699,42.186087],[-87.789661,42.187318],[-87.788641,42.187836],[-87.790506,42.190556],[-87.789428,42.191419],[-87.789369,42.191808],[-87.789748,42.192153],[-87.791001,42.192801],[-87.792312,42.193621],[-87.793506,42.195218],[-87.794002,42.195822],[-87.794672,42.196168],[-87.795167,42.196146],[-87.795692,42.195995],[-87.797323,42.195283],[-87.797614,42.198348],[-87.797294,42.200938],[-87.79677,42.201758],[-87.796595,42.202168],[-87.796624,42.202427],[-87.797352,42.203614],[-87.795896,42.20247],[-87.793069,42.198931],[-87.791758,42.196578],[-87.791205,42.195542],[-87.789136,42.193513],[-87.785669,42.189045],[-87.784271,42.186562],[-87.781969,42.183518],[-87.776055,42.175875],[-87.772835,42.17119],[-87.770446,42.168426],[-87.767475,42.16523]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"A4","holc_grade":"A","area_description_data":{"2":"100% ","3":"January 4, 1900 one-family owner built","5":"","6":"$16,000-18,000","7":" ","8":"This section is about 98 per cent improved, but most properties have considerable ground.

This is a little community by itself, which will continue to be desirable to live in for many years.","9":"Washington Heights B April 25, 1900 October 1, 1939","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Business and Professional","1c":"December 30, 1899 ","1d":"December 30, 1899","1e":"None","2a":"Bungalows; 5-6 rooms ","2b":"Brick ","2c":"10-12 years ","2d":"Good ","2e":"December 30, 1899 ","2f":"December 30, 1899 ","2g":"$6,500-8,000 ","2h":"$6,500-8,000   ","2i":"(1939-Oct.) $6,500-8,000   ","2j":"Good up to $6,500 ","2k":"Static ","2l":"Not a ","2m":"Rent   ","2n":"Area   ","2o":"$50.00 average ","2p":"Static ","4a":"","4b":"","5a":"December 31, 1899","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.649016,41.731254],[-87.648767,41.727662],[-87.649623,41.727689],[-87.649694,41.728354],[-87.6503,41.728301],[-87.650229,41.724789],[-87.651334,41.724709],[-87.651334,41.722261],[-87.662386,41.722021],[-87.663016,41.722699],[-87.662885,41.728088],[-87.663099,41.731015],[-87.649016,41.731254]],[[-87.653081,41.726864],[-87.653116,41.728461],[-87.655469,41.728487],[-87.655398,41.726838],[-87.653081,41.726864]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B117","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"2":"December 30, 1899 December 30, 1899","3":"February 8, 1900 Brick; 5-7R $6,000-6,500 Owner built","5":"","6":"Ample, 5-5 1/2%, Ins.","7":" ","8":"Predominately a bungalow neighborhood with a trend to the moderate type of home; interspersed throughout with many 2 and 3-flat apartments, a few 4's, and some large apartment buildings.

Much new construction on Aberdeen, which is unpaved. Buildings are older on Bishop, which was the beginning of new development in area. On Justice, Laflin, and Bishop, are many vacant lots. Vicennes, on east of area, a main highway, is an old trail. Area is one which will continue to grow. Cheap frames are on east side of Carpenter south of 90th; on Racine, brick bungalows. New park is under construction between Racine and Throop, 91st to 92nd, under WPA; opposite the park on west, between 91st and 92nd, are 4-flats- then bungalows. South of 90th is a spotted area of mixed grade, extending too 93rd. Facing park on west side of Throop, between 91st and 92nd, are 4-flats- then bungalows. Elizabeth St., facing Fort Dearborn school, is mixed frame and brick bungalows and 2-flats, somewhat cheap home construction.

It is sometimes referred to as the \"Ridge\", which boundaries are approximately from 91st to 119th between the Rock Island Suburban and Western Avenue (the highest point on Cook County is at 111th and Hoyne). In this area of Beverly Hills, approximately 25 per cent of the properties are valued at in excess of $25,000- some of them as high as $75,000 to $100,000. The inhabitants are of high grade and the population stable. Many of the homes here were purchased in the inflation period, and a large proportion are mortgaged. For the most part, lawns, shrubs and trees are quite numerous and there is ample evidence of good up-keep. 95th Street, on the north, is zoned for business. Between 103rd and 107th north to 104th, and a very large apartment building located on the northeast corner of 104th and Wood. There are also some apartments on Claremont (which is zoned for apartments) between 103rd and (over) 107th; and on Longwood Drive on the east, between 108th and 110th. The principal development of this area has occurred since 1900 and, for the most part, was on Longwood Drive and adjacent thereto, between 103rd and 95th. Between 103rd and 107th, on Seeley Avenue, are some old homes of 25 to 30 years of age. Bell, Oakley and Claremont, for about two blocks north of 107th, is a substantial brick bungalow neighborhood. Damen Street north from 101st has a somewhat newer development- then tapers off to the north with an older type cost home. Seeley Street, south of 95th to 99th, is not quite as good as that portion of it from 99th south to 101st. Hoyne, north of 103rd, is a mixture of stucco, frame and brick; quite old for one block and then developing into much better homes as far north as 95th. South of 104th on Claremont are some brick two-flats. North on Bell and Leavitt from 107th is all built up with good, substantial homes. Seeley north of 107th, is somewhat older with several stucco and frame between 105th and 103rd; and Longwood south from 103rd is a mixture of old frame and brick homes located considerably away from the street, almost entirely on the west side. These homes are not so substantial between 106th and 107th. At the northwest corner of 107th and Longwood south from 103rd is a large old home that probably cost around $100,000, which has been converted into a girls' private schools. This apparently was done against the zoning ordinance but is an example of what happens to some of these old homes. There have been approximately 50 to 75 new homes; 6-8 rooms; brick; and in the price category of $10,000-15,000 built in the area during the past year. Thsi new construction has taken place, for the most part, in the western section, to which there is a trend. It is well to bear in mind that there are no restrictions against the sale to negroes of property north of 107th in the area west of Vicennes. To the southeast, between 107th and 115th, there is an extensive colored district which lies between Vicennes and Morgan Street. Beverley Hills area enjoys a good turnover of property, although the market can be said to be a buyer's. It is also believed to have a comparatively small percentage of homes free of encumbrance. The majority of people residing here work in the Loop district of the city. The area enjoys good schools, shopping facilities and transportation; and a high degree of ownership is evident.

In it reside many of the so-called \"elite\" of the Beverly Hills Morgan Park district. It is considerably older than the area lying to the north; frame buildings here run from 35 to 50 years of age and the bricks of more recent construction, 10 to 20 years. As in Beverly Hills, a high degree of ownership exists. The area enjoys fair to good transportation, all utilities are in, assessments paid, schools good. Here is a well-known section of this a well-known, national military academy, the Morgan Park Military Academy, whose buildings are located between 110th Place and 113th between Hoyne and Bell. The northern section of this area, north of 111th, is the older. Turnover of property is approximately the saame as in the Beverley Hills area. This section has always been considered a high-grade one, but the development of Beverley Hills to the north has had the effect of classifying the area as somewhat inferior to Beverley Hills. Age and obsolescence here is showing its effect, but the area is still desirable. There are some homes in here up to $50,000. (over) At present there is under way a movement to restrict the sale of property to colored people in the district between Rock Island Suburban west to Western Avenue, south of 107th. At present, there is a restriction as to sale to colored people west of Vicennes to the Rock Island Suburban, south of 107th. On Bell Avenue, south of 111th, are many old frame and brick homes; and on Hoyne Avenue south of 111th, homes are predominately frame for one block where it enters Lothair, where buildings are large frame and brick, located on large lots, well kept up with shrubs, trees, etc. On the east side of Longwood, north from 111th, are apartments; and on Seeley south from 107th are high-priced, beautiful brick and stone homes, tapering off south of 108th. West on 110th Place, older buildings appea, mixed iwth new bungalows; and 109th is somewhat older, with some new construction. On Drew Street are fine old homes of brick, frame and stucco. Although this area has attained its peak and property sales are in a buyer's market, the area will continue for some time to house a most desirable type of inhabitant. South of 107th, it will be noticed there are few through streets as far south as 119th. Consequently, there are few tourists or sightseers prowling around, and although this may hurt business, it is a favorable feature toward the continuation of the area as a residential one. Lots are reported to be had at from $1,000-1,500, the average width 35 to 40 feet and 125 feet depth, and some bargains can be obtained.","9":"Morgan Park B May 4, 1900 November 1, 1939","1a":"Yes moderately  ","1b":"Business- Professional- Executive","1c":"December 30, 1899 December 30, 1899","1d":"December 30, 1899","1e":"None","2a":"Singles; 5-8 rooms NOTE: a few 4 1/2-6 units on 111th between Western","2b":"Brick and frame and Longwood; and the east side of Longwood","2c":"Brick- 10-20 years; frame- 25-50 years between 111th and 112th","2d":"Brick: good; frame: fair ","2e":"December 31, 1899 ","2f":"December 30, 1899 ","2g":"$4,250-12,500 ","2h":"$5,000-15,000   ","2i":"(1939-Nov.) $5,000-15,000   ","2j":"Fair up to $9,500 ","2k":"Static ","2l":"$32.50-60.00 ","2m":"$40.00-75.00   ","2n":"(1939-Nov.) $40.00-75.00   ","2o":"Good up to $75.00 ","2p":"Static ","4a":"","4b":"","5a":"December 31, 1899","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.679667,41.684522],[-87.679795,41.687424],[-87.672822,41.687557],[-87.673891,41.68351],[-87.674961,41.680794],[-87.675495,41.677465],[-87.677028,41.677465],[-87.67792,41.678477],[-87.678169,41.678957],[-87.677884,41.679542],[-87.677492,41.679968],[-87.677599,41.6809],[-87.677706,41.681566],[-87.678027,41.681806],[-87.678312,41.681726],[-87.679168,41.681726],[-87.678989,41.682258],[-87.678847,41.68319],[-87.679096,41.683803],[-87.679667,41.684522]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B126","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"2":"December 31, 1899 ","3":"January 14, 1900 Sgle: 6-8R $9,500-15,000 Owners","5":"","6":"Ample, 5%","7":" ","8":"This area is a fairly recent development; average age of about 15 years; almost entirely a home owner neighborhood.

It is some distance from schools, and inquiry here for property is somewhat limietd, although the future outlook is promising. The area is also part of Morgan Park, which was annexed to Chicago in 1914. Transportation is good, and the fact that there are no through streets adds to its desirability as a residential section. Sale of property to colored people west of Vicennes to the Rock Island Suburban is retricted north as far as 107th, and it is expected the same restrictions will be completed soon as far west as Western Avenue and south to 119th. It will be seen, therefore, that the area south of 107th, acts as a buffer to Beverley Hills insofar as sale restrictinos to the colored element are concerned. Longwood Drive on the west side has many beautiful homes set away back from the street, with lawns, shrubbery, trees, etc. There is much vacant property for development to the west of the area to the (over) Baltimore & Ohio freight line. At this point, the Mount Hope Cemetery is encountered. There are many vacant lots south of 115th, and most of the new homes south of 115th have been constructed since 1929. On the eastern side of Bell Street are many fine homes, and between 116th and 118th, vacant prpoerty is set out for school purposes. Bell Street changes abruptly at 119th to homes of cheaper construction. North of 119th on east Oakley are expensive homes and some recent substantial development- vacant land is work approximately $35.00 per foot.

Schools are also very good and transportation available by commuter tarin, North Shore Electric, as well as elevated which ends at Third and Linden. Properties along Sheridan Road are somewhat better than those on the other streets, but they are less desirable because of the heavy traffic flow along Sheridan Road, particularly on Sunday. Properties in east Wilmette carry a certain social advantage and this reputation is traded upon whenever properties are sold. Pride of ownership is very apparent, most properties being well shrubbed. The streets are lined with beautiful, large, shade trees. Vacancy is virtually nill, and becausae of this heavy occupancy there is some indication that an upward adjustment in rents may be affected during 1940. The price bracket above includes the majority of the structures, but there are a number of estate properties valued well above $20,000. Mortgage financing is limited to $16,000 as a matter of policy by most major lenders. This is not meant to indicate that (over) financing is not available in the district. Properties along the south side of Lake Ave. west of Sheridan Road are very good. Altho it might be said that many of the structures in this territoty are somewhat obsolete, considerable reconditioning and remodeling is continually taking place, and the section is certainly considered to be \"holding its own\", at the present time. The northern tip of this area is somewhat adversely affected by the proximity to a section called \"No Man's Land\", which has recently been annexed to the village of Wilmette. The legallity of this annexatino is now being contested in the courts, but irrespective of the outcome, the adverse influence will probably continue altho is will be necessarily minimized should the village gain control, as they will probably eliminate all small business and possibly close the beach to other than local residents. The new construction has been a recent subdivision of a piece of vacant ground lying along the railroad at the end of the extension of Ashland and Greenwood Aves. This was a speculative development, and more favorably located should warrant a \"A\" classification, but because of its proximity to the railroad it is rated as \"B\".

This neighborhood is very well located and is particuarly convenient to both elevated and commuter train transportation, the latter stopping at Main St. there are about six houses on Dempster, between Judson and Forest Aves., which are and have been for a number of years, occupied by negroes. Their location in this vicinity adversely affects the adjoining properties, but it is very doubtful that they will ever spread any further than they already are. The bulk of the property in this section is very well held, and has many occupants of long standing in their present structures. Apartment buildings are concentrated on Hinman, south of Lee St. and on Michigan, Sheridan, and Sheridan Square, south of Keeney. These structures came into the area prior to 1929 and are generally speaking, first class apartments renting for an average of $20.00 per room. The residential structures on these (over) three streets are older than the bulk of the properties in the area as a whole, and should be graded no better than third class, primarily because they are noticeably obsolete. Their value is only slightly above the value of the ground, and it is generally believed that when apartment house construction again gets under way, many of these units will be razed and the ground improved with apartments similar to those already here. Rents quotes above on two and three family structures are for heated units. The higher priced two and three structures are for heated units. The higher priced two and three family structures are in most cases deluxe buildings. One family units in the balance of the territory range from good to mediocre, but because of the favorable reputation of East Evanston, the neighborhood is graded as second grade, but rated as minus becaues its future seems somewhat unassured. There is a good shopping center on Main St. and a first class shopping center around the intersection of Sherman and Davis. There is little possibility of this neighborhood being adversely affected in the near future, by an infiltration of a class other than that which occupies the neighborhood today. Hinman is the least desirable street because of heavy traffic, and because west side backs up to business on Chicago Ave. Asssessed values are high.","9":"Evanston, Ill.

Proximity to Lake Michigan is favorable, but there are practically no riparian properties except between Kedzie and Keeney, and between Lee and Main on Edgemere Road. These two short blocks because of their riparian rights warrant a first class rating, but are included in this area because of their small size. Houses on Edgemere are particularly outstanding and their age is only about 12 years. The lake front, except as noted above, is all park district with many bathing beaches along its entire length. Each year a separate bathing beach is designated for the large colored population living in Evanston, the thought being a constant shifting of this locatino would minimize the adverse affect of negro bathing facilities. Living in the area are some of Evanston's fine, old wealth families, and in spite of the age of the structures, the neighborhood continues as one of the most desirable along the shore. Schools and churches are particularly good and transportation is available by either elevated or commuter train. Main Street (over) and Davis St. are the main shopping centers. Rentals on these larger houses have remained unchanged in recent years but vacancy has decreased. In a few cases some of the large houses have nothing more than caretaker occupancy at nominal rents. The neighborhood is graded \"B\" because of the age of the buildings, but could almost warrant a more favorable rating from the standpoint of class of occupancy and Lake Michigan location. The new construction is located on Forest Ave. at Burnham Place. This site is a former estate which has been broken up for subdividing purposes. The houses were built to individual specifications. Further development of this character may be anticipated, but it is rather doubtful that it will be of very large proportions. Assessed values are high.","9":"Evanston, Ill.

The three-family units, however, are largely concentrated primarily west of California and constitute about 25 per cent of the structures, valued $12,000-14,000 and renting for $60 to $75. These units show a slight weakness in price structure because of the inclination of institutional holders to force these properties into the market. The somewhat unfavorable experience in prices on one-family houses is occasioned by the competition of new construction occurring in this area, and in the area immediately to the north and northwest. Although only a minimum of new construction is occurring in this section, it is of a lower grade than that that is already here. It is anticipated that further construction will continue but it will be in a price range between $7,000 and $8,500. The prices quoted above on all classes of units (over) are expected to remain relatively firm during the next six to twelve months. The general reputation of the section is good. Shopping centers and schools west of California are somewhat inconvenient but improvements throughout the area are comparatively uniform. There is a sizeable number of deluxe three-family units valued in today's market between $15,000 and $19,000 renting between $80.00 and $95.00 per unit. Larger apartments constitute about 20 per cent of the buildings and rent for $10.00 to $12.00 per room. Prices on two-family units have remained relatively stable primarily because these buildings are so well held. Although there are a few Jewish families in this neighborhood, no marked infiltration is noticeable at the present time, and the section should remain fairly stable during the next three to five years.","9":"Rogers Park 2nd B-73 Oct. 1939","1a":"Slowly  ","1b":"Middle class- some upper middle class","1c":"5% Jewish","1d":"0%","1e":"","2a":"One-family; 6-8 rooms Two-family; 5-6 rooms","2b":"Brick Brick","2c":"12-14 years 12-18 years","2d":"Good Good","2e":"99-100% 98-99%","2f":"70% 60%","2g":"$7,000-10,500 $8,000-10,500","2h":"$8,000-12,000 11+ $9,000-12,000 14+","2i":"(1939-Oct.) $7,500-11,750 4- (1939-Oct.) $9,000-12,000 December 30, 1899","2j":"Good- up to $9,000 Fairly good- up to $11,000","2k":"Firm Firm","2l":"$35.00-55.00 $55.00-67.50","2m":"$45.00-65.00 22+ $60.00-75.00 10+","2n":"(1939-Oct.) $45.00-65.00 December 30, 1899 (1939-Oct.) $60.00-75.00 December 30, 1899","2o":"Good- up to $55.00 Good- up to $67.50","2p":"Firm Firm","4a":"December 31, 1899","4b":"","5a":"January 2, 1900","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.682261,41.997681],[-87.689748,41.997669],[-87.689813,42.000186],[-87.683039,42.000121],[-87.683039,42.002897],[-87.681816,42.002897],[-87.681772,42.004684],[-87.689879,42.004684],[-87.690233,42.005053],[-87.690247,42.00722],[-87.686008,42.007204],[-87.681117,42.00707],[-87.680068,42.004674],[-87.68009,41.997685],[-87.682261,41.997681]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B74","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"2":"35% 15%","3":"December 30, 1899  ","5":"","6":"Ample","7":" See tax rates page 4","8":"This high class neighborhood is almost solidly built of good class apartments.

The more expensive rentals quoted above for three-family units are semi-deluxe buildings where apartments have two baths. The more favorable increase in prices indicated on three-family units between 1935 and 1936 is occasioned by the seriously depressed values on this class of property during most of the depression. There is a possibility that the Edgewater Golf Club may eventually be sub-divided and at present it is assessed for $10,000 per acre which would mean that any development would be equally high grade.

There are very few properties rented here, and non available at present. Eastward of this area is a bungalow area entirely built up. At the west is the adjacent village of River Forst.

In many respects it compares to the Back Bay section of Boston, for it is very conveniently located, has high-class occupancy, has seen considerable remodeling and reconditioning and reduction of size of units in some of the large apartment buildings. Altho properties are built comparatively close to the sidewalk and (illegible comment) adjoining walls, trend of desirability continues static and demand is good from persons who want an \"in town\" location. Astor St. has only local traffic and, as such, is a better residential street than State or Dearborn. It is also restricted against more than 3 story buildings at the north end, whereas, in the south no restriction is operative on Dearborn or State. They, therefore, have some speculative value for demolition and erection of apartment house units. Real estate taxes are exceptionally high. There are several cooperative apartment buildings at the south end of Astor. Rentals on apartment units of 6 rooms and more are slightly weak at the present time; but, on smaller units, they are very strong. The trend of reducing these bigger units to smaller kitchenette apartments (over) may be expected to continue. In spite of its age, the area continues to attract very high-class people and, in many respects, the district is equally desirable as Lake Shore Drive, because of its seclusion from the heavy traffic. Transportation is by bus along the Drive. Lake Michigan beaches are convenient and generally considered favorable, altho they do attract a much less desirable class of persons from sections to the west. A few of the houses are operated as rooming houses, but most properties are so strongly held that it is doubtful if the district will ever become a rooming house district in its entirety. Neighborhood is graded second class because of the good class occupancy and because it continues as a desirable residential sectino in spite of its advancing age.","9":"Chicago 2nd B-95 Mar. 1940","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Upper class- upper middle class","1c":"0% ","1d":"0%","1e":"15% Jewish in houses because of restriction in apts.","2a":"One family 7-15 rooms Apts- 4-15 rooms","2b":"Stone- some brick Brick","2c":"30 years 15-20 years","2d":"Good Good","2e":"93%- increasing 80% in large; 97% in small","2f":"60% ","2g":"No Market ","2h":"   ","2i":"   ","2j":"Fair ","2k":"Firm ","2l":"$165.00-300.00 ","2m":"$200.00-350.00 18+  20+","2n":"(1940-Mar.) $200.00-350.00 December 30, 1899 $27.50-35-in large units (6r or more); $40.00-50-in small units 10-","2o":"Good- fewer available Soft- larger units; Good-small units","2p":"Firm Firm","4a":"","4b":"","5a":"","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.623398,41.900598],[-87.619713,41.900701],[-87.617455,41.897228],[-87.623189,41.89725],[-87.623398,41.900598]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B96","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"2":"95% ","3":"December 30, 1899  ","5":"","6":"","7":" ","8":"This section is known as Streeterville.

There is row after row of these two-family buildings all set back exactly the same distance from the street, giving the area the appearance of barracks rather than a residential neighborhood. Financing was originally secured through one of the large insurance companies and they still have substantial holdings of foreclosed properties in this territory. The original construction was only fair. Experience on re-sales has found it necessary to do substantial reconditioning. Rents quoted above on two family structures are for unheated units. It is pertinent to say that about a year ago some of these rents were increased to $40.00 and vacancies increased very sharply immediately. They were all therefore readjusted to a maximum of $37.50. The bungalows are of stereotyped appearance and feel the influence of the heavy overhand in two family buildings.

Proximity to the railroad and industrial areas on the north edges of this territory adversely affects the adjacent blocks.

Large apartments are primarily concentrated in the first few blocks northwest from Logan Square with several along Logan Boulevard and Kedzie boulevard south of Logan Square; rents range from $9-11 per room in these structuers.","9":"Logan Square 3rd C-118 Nov. 1939","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Middle and lower middle class","1c":"15% Mixture","1d":"0%","1e":"Better class replacing Jewish","2a":"2-family; 6 rooms 1-family; 6 rooms","2b":"brick- many stucco- frame Frame- brick","2c":"35-40 years 35-40 years","2d":"Fair Fair","2e":"95-96% 99-100%","2f":"50% 85%","2g":"$4,500-5,750 $2,250-3,600","2h":"$5,000-6,500 12+ $2,500-4,000 11+","2i":"(1939) $5,000-6,500 December 30, 1899 (1939) $2,500-4,000 December 30, 1899","2j":"Fair- $6,000 Fair","2k":"Firm Firm","2l":"$26.00-35.00 $26.00-35.00","2m":"$30.00-40.00 15+ $30.00-40.00 15+","2n":"(1939) $30.00-40.00 December 30, 1899 (1939) $30.00-40.00 December 30, 1899","2o":"Fairly good- $35.00 Good- $35.00","2p":"Firm Firm","4a":"January 1, 1900","4b":"","5a":"January 9, 1900","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.717366,41.924607],[-87.708239,41.924642],[-87.708002,41.919974],[-87.702535,41.920044],[-87.702725,41.92199],[-87.706385,41.921884],[-87.706485,41.92493],[-87.697164,41.924855],[-87.697068,41.917356],[-87.716748,41.917285],[-87.717366,41.924607]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C119","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"40% 40%","3":"December 30, 1899  ","5":"","6":"B&L.A. - 50% @6% /7 10 yr.","7":" ","8":"This old area of mixed housing is declining in desirability as obsolescence and poor maintenance become more apparent throughout.

Melrose Park is populated principally by persons of German descent, altho it has been known as an Italian community. Some improvement has been seen here due to a change of local administration and the induction of a new Chief of Police. Despite this improvement, the town has a bad name with lending agencies, and it is quite difficult to secure mortgage loans without FHA provision. About the only company willing to lend here on funds is the Bell Savings Building $ Loans Assn. One developer built about 60 brick bungalows in Melrose Park, which did not sell rapidly enoguh to suit him, whereupon he had his workmen sign contracts for the property and obtained loans from the North American Life Ins. Co., which institution soon became the owner through foreclosure of the bungalows, and is, at present, the principal institutional owner of foreclosed property within this area. (over) The terrain is level with some planting of saplings along the newer portions, and well-grown trees in the older sections. It is the best spot in Melrose Park, and those who have to live here are edging this way. Transportation is reasonably convenient via Lake St. surface lines, and also by the Chicago & North Westren Railroad to the loop. About 31 minutes is required by train to the Chicago loop; a 54 ride monthly ticket costs $7.35. The area is about 75% built up and it developing very slowly, principally in the north end. The nearest shopping center is Broadway near the southwest corner of the area. There are other and better shopping facilities in Maywood, about one mile distant, accessible via Lake St. surface lines. Rather poor demand, lack of charm, and age of structures, together with mixed population indicate third grade.","9":"Melrose Park, Ill. 3rd C-124 Feb. 1940","1a":"Very Slowly  ","1b":"\"White-collar\" commuters- Melrose Park business men","1c":"70% German/Swedish-Lutheran","1d":"0%","1e":"None","2a":"Singles- 5-7 rooms ","2b":"Frame- brick ","2c":"20 years ","2d":"Fair ","2e":"98% ","2f":"75% ","2g":"$4,250-5,500 ","2h":"$4,750-5,750 8+  ","2i":"(1940-Feb.) $5,000-6,000 5+  ","2j":"Slow- $5,500 ","2k":"Possibly up ","2l":"$20.00-30.00 ","2m":"$25.00-35.00 10+  ","2n":"(1940-Feb.) $30.00-40.00 17+  ","2o":"$35.00- good ","2p":"Upward ","4a":"December 30, 1899","4b":"January 19, 1900","5a":"January 14, 1900","5b":"January 3, 1900"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.874083,41.880089],[-87.877376,41.880309],[-87.877346,41.88115],[-87.883139,41.881039],[-87.882991,41.881946],[-87.882456,41.882411],[-87.881535,41.882654],[-87.874434,41.884733],[-87.874083,41.880089]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C125","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"N/A ","3":"December 30, 1899  ","5":"","6":"Limited","7":" ","8":"This is a flat and somewhat older portion of the village built up along the Elevated Railway, and comprised of old, frame houses interspersed with a few brick bungalows not quite so old.

Poor surroundings at the west, hospital influence at the south, cemetery at the east, and somewhat remote location indicate third grade area.","9":"Maywood, Ill. 3rd C-131 Feb. 1940","1a":"  Yes","1b":"\"White-collar\" commuters- small business- clerks","1c":"0% ","1d":"0%","1e":"None","2a":"Singles- 5-6 room bungalows ","2b":"Frame- stucco- brick ","2c":"15-18 years ","2d":"Fair to good ","2e":"98% ","2f":"75% ","2g":"$4,000-7,000 ","2h":"$4,250-8,000 11+  ","2i":"(1940-Feb.) $4,500-9,000 10+  ","2j":"Good- $6,500 ","2k":"Steady ","2l":"$32.50-60.00 ","2m":"$35.00-65.00 8+  ","2n":"(1940-Feb.) $35.00-65.00 December 30, 1899  ","2o":"Good- $65.00 ","2p":"Up ","4a":"January 6, 1900","4b":"only a few (12)","5a":"January 10, 1900","5b":"January 19, 1900"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.87861,41.855418],[-87.882023,41.85539],[-87.881994,41.858024],[-87.878724,41.858074],[-87.87861,41.855418]]],[[[-87.8705,41.859759],[-87.870224,41.856275],[-87.87165,41.856254],[-87.871555,41.854243],[-87.874046,41.854115],[-87.873951,41.852522],[-87.8757,41.852472],[-87.875777,41.854236],[-87.874465,41.854299],[-87.874474,41.856233],[-87.872268,41.856346],[-87.872402,41.857918],[-87.874807,41.85789],[-87.874883,41.859738],[-87.8705,41.859759]]],[[[-87.869457,41.867183],[-87.869385,41.865324],[-87.870776,41.865386],[-87.870847,41.8672],[-87.869457,41.867183]]],[[[-87.872759,41.868864],[-87.872511,41.866829],[-87.876219,41.866793],[-87.876361,41.868793],[-87.872759,41.868864]]],[[[-87.872759,41.868864],[-87.87276,41.868873],[-87.872737,41.868864],[-87.872759,41.868864]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C132","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"85% 15%","3":"January 4, 1900 2 story brick houses $7,500 Spec. moderately","5":"","6":"Ample- usually FHA","7":" ","8":"The entire territory lying within the limits of Westchester is discussed under a single descriptino sheet, altho development therein consists in four widely separate groups of residences. In general, north of the Illinois Central Railroad is somewhat less desirable than the territory lying south of this line and west of the Elevated railway (Westchester Blvd.) Construction shown on the map is entirely two-family brick dwellings. East of this boulevard are almost entirely brick bungalows. LaGrange Road (U.S. Route 45/12) is the western boundary shown on the map, and along the west side of this boulevard is a large cemetery, while at the very northwest tip of the village as shown on the map is a large and active stone quarry. However, these are not of any great influence on present residential development, which is more influenced by the fact that there are no \"eyesores\" near at hand, and direct transportation via the Elevated railway is available. Demand is slow at present, but very likely to improve as this village develops. It is understood that one of the principal developers in the Chicago area has acquired large acreage in Westchester for future development. (over) Heavy assessments originally put on in 1929 have retarded Westchester to a great extent. These approximate $25.00 a foot plus interest, which brings the total to about $40.00 a foot where no payments have been made from the inception of the assessments. Shopping facilities are very remote and limited. Churches are inaccessible, but there is a good small grammar school at the southeast portion of the built-up area. High school is about 4 miles distant in Maywood. The Chicago Title & Trust CO. has been substantially interested in Westchester. Paving bonds are held by the original paving contractor, who is not inclined to reduce his claim. Lots which are readily mortgaged at abotu $1,000 each, due to special assessments, must bring from $2,500-3,000 in order to satisfy all claimants. A recent offer of $1,000 a piece for 40 acres of these lots was not accepted. Provided some compromise can be affected, partially writing off these speical assessments, Westchester should normally see rapid development; which would justify a second grade; but due to present poor convenience and lack of amenities is graded only \"C plus\".","9":"Westchester, Ill.

Taxes are somewhat high due to zoning, which however, has been helpful in securing loans incidental to the sale of old properties. There are many apartment buildings along Washington, Randoph, Pleasant, Maple and Wisconsin Aves.; also Oak Park and Kenilworth. Institutions are shy of this area and have continually reduced prices on their large, old, foreclosed houses. It is pertinent to note that a central heating plant supplies many of the homes within (over) this area and that the cost of such heating is slightly higher than by individual plants.

The land alone is taxed based on a valuation exceeding that amount. This area is favored by good transportation and by proximity to a good Catholic Church and parochial school. There are a few scattered two flats in which units rent for about $55. Columbus Park on the south affords exceptional recreational advantages. The Hawthorne Building & Loan, Bell Savings Building & Loan, and Prairie State Bank have loaned in this area, without the FHA insurance provision. The amounts are stated to be up to 50% and in some cases 60%, of current appraisals.

Cicero Ave. from Madison Ave. northward for 2 or 3 blocks is heavily built up with three story apartment buildings, having stores on the first floor. The area is within easy walking distance of the Austin high school, and furthermore has the advantage of excellent transportation facilities both at the north and south extremities, in addition to which there is the transportation available north and south along Laramie Ave. and Cicero Ave. Desirability decreases approaching the small (over) industrial establishments grouped along Lake St. at the north end. Neighborhood stores are plentiful along Cicero, Madison, and Lake Sts., but better shopping facilities are found in Oak Park three miles distance (west). There are some row houses along Fulton, LeClaire, Leamington, and LaCrosse, for which there are very ltitle demand. This area is about 100% built up and land values may be expressed in terms of $40-100 a front foot; with $40 values beginning in the north end and $100 neighborhood in the south.

There has also been considerable conversion of large homes and apartment house units into 2 and 3-room kitchenette apartments. Most properties are built immediately adjoining, with a maximum setback of about 15 feet. State and Dearborn both carry very heavy traffic and, because of the high use of the land, the appearance of the neighborhood is somewhat congested. Chicago's famous Ambassador Hotel is located on the northwest corner of State and Goethe. It is somewhat unfair to this district to say that it is declining in general desirability; but, because of its age and obsolescence (the latter being minimized by reconditioning and remodeling) the area is, nevertheless, graded third class because of its general appearance. Due consideratino must be given to the location, because of its convenience to Lake Michigan beaches and downtown Chicago. (over) Generally speaking, it is comparatively homogeneous and continues to attract fairly good class people and it is doubtful that any infiltration of noticeably less desirable tenants will soon occur. The ground is now 100 per cent built up, but restrictinos on State St. permit buildings of more than three stories and there is reason to believe that favorable locations may be replaced with large apartment house units, although activity iin this class of structure is arrested in Chicago at the present time. Construction costs indicate that rentals must average at least $17.00 per room to encourage any construction of apartments in an area of this kind. In the portion of the area south of Division St., buildings are quite uniformly 3 story, row type units, also favorably occupied and in good demand, but somewhat older than those properties north of Division St. These streets are probably even more congested than those north of Division St., but trend of desirability compares favorably throughout this entire section.","9":"Chicago 3rd C-157 Mar. 1940","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Middle class- \"white collar\" workers","1c":"0% ","1d":"0%","1e":"Rooming house tenants","2a":"One family 7-10 rooms ","2b":"Brick- stone ","2c":"40 years ","2d":"Fairly good ","2e":"100% ","2f":"Moderate ","2g":"$12,000-25,000 ","2h":"$12,000-25,000 December 30, 1899  ","2i":"$12,000-25,000 December 30, 1899  ","2j":"Fair ","2k":"Firm ","2l":"$85.00-125.00 ","2m":"$100.00-150.00 18+  ","2n":"$100.00-150.00 December 30, 1899  ","2o":"Good ","2p":"Firm ","4a":"","4b":"","5a":"","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.739964,41.868574],[-87.740105,41.872682],[-87.720184,41.873434],[-87.720154,41.868655],[-87.724923,41.868611],[-87.725071,41.865934],[-87.735142,41.865783],[-87.739867,41.865713],[-87.739964,41.868574]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C158","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"65% 15%","3":"None  ","5":"","6":"Limited","7":" ","8":"Unheated units in 2-flats are renting for $20.00 to $32.50.

Properties fairly priced will move fairly well, but buyers are largely Jewish and sharp bargainers. Graded third because of appearance and heterogeneous mixture of housing but rated well becaues of location wet of Pulaski.

Land values range from $20-22 a foot, but loans are not easily obtained because of the age of properties.

Activity, however, in this plant is far below capacity and incomes to persons living in this territory are relatively low. Most houses are built on 25' lots and rather close to the sidewalks, which gives a very congester appearance and gives the section a character more typical of a close-in section of Chicago proper. Foreclosures were fairly heavy, but most of this has been absorbed again. A number of the two family structures in this area were originally one family units which have been since converted. The better fram twos selling around $6,500 are situated on Darrow Ave. The brick twos on this street range from $7,500 to $8,500. South of Main St. building is rather widely scattered, and it is in this territory that the new construction has occurred. These new building are over-improvements for the area, and sales have been fair to poor. Because of the poor acceptance of these new buildings, this section is also grade third class, and it is (over) very doubtful that anything less than a building boom would improve the rating to be assigned to the south portion. Transportation and shopping centers are inconvenient. Obsolescence is a very noticeable factor but because of the low rent scale for Evanston this section is well occupied. There is a slight possibility that there will be an advance in prices during 1940 in spite of the certain downward trend in desirability now established.","9":"Evanston, Ill.

Due to the location of the area adjacent to the lake, and within 12 minutes of the Loop by fast interruption, kept up. Turnover of property good. Area is protected by the IC Suburban from infiltration of undesirable inhabitants from the southwest. Better part lies north of 75th; and adjoining at 71st is the South Shore Country Club and Yacht Harbor. Lake park water frontage on Lake Michigan adjoins on the entire eastern length of area. Due to age of many of these old frame residences; (2) that man of the large hotels and apartments are in receivers' hands; (3) because of the ever-increasing number of night and day bathers in summer, the area cannot be classed better grade. Future trend, however, will be toward building newer and better hotels and ap'ts to accommodate those who desire to live close to the Loop and yet have all advantages of bathing and yachting facilities close by. * There is also another bathing colony of frame shacks at 74th and South Shore Drive.","9":"South Chicago C August 31, 1900 December 1, 1939","1a":"Yes  ","1b":"Business and professional","1c":"December 30, 1899 ","1d":"December 30, 1899","1e":"None","2a":"Singles; 1-1 1/2 story; 6 to 12 rooms 6's and up & elevator type","2b":"Frame and brick Brick","2c":"50 yrs; 40 yrs 20 years","2d":"Poor; good Good","2e":"December 31, 1899 December 31, 1899","2f":"December 30, 1899 December 30, 1899","2g":"(F) $5,000-6,000; (B) $7,000-10,000 In hands of","2h":"Same as 1935  receivers ","2i":"Same as 1937   ","2j":"Good at above Poor, due to receivership","2k":"Up will ultimately be up","2l":"Few, if any, $12.00 per room","2m":"For  $12.00 per room ","2n":"Rent  (1939-Dec.) $12.00 per room ","2o":"Good when available Good","2p":"Up Up","4a":"December 31, 1899","4b":"","5a":"January 3, 1900","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.5614,41.75182],[-87.561285,41.744559],[-87.563602,41.744585],[-87.563709,41.746261],[-87.566311,41.746261],[-87.56624,41.744452],[-87.575082,41.744319],[-87.585492,41.751711],[-87.566169,41.751873],[-87.5614,41.75182]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C245","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"December 30, 1899 December 30, 1899","3":"December 30, 1899  ","5":"","6":"Limited, 5 1/2-6% B&L Ins.","7":" ","8":"Lying between 79th and 83rd, South Chicago Avenue to Colfax, this is a bungalow area; poor transportation, fair shopping facilities.

Prices have stiffened in the past two years since many of the foreclosed properties have been sold off. In 1935 it was next to impossible to get an offer; all were for sale. However, generally, the mortgage plus taxes and interest amounted to more than the value of the buildings, and accordingly there were not many sold until foreclosure caused the redution in price. The area was built about the peak with easy money and liberal financing and small equities. This was speculative construction, and 3 flats originally sold from $25,000 to $26,000. The area becomes less desirable near the railroad, and the best portion on the other hand is along Blackstone, Dante, and Harper. Shops, schools, and churches are reasonably convenient, but poor transportation has hurt the area. About 50% improved at present. It is expected that further building will come in here, and the future may possibly be upward. B&L's lend 70 per cent of the appraisal at 5% interest and 2% commission.

There is extensive vacant property south of 107th to 111th between Western and California and also south of 111th to 113th west to Rockwell. In this area there is some new construction interspersed with old brick bungalows and an occasional 3-flat building. Between 107th and 111th west of Rockwell, there is new construction; 2-story bricks, $6,000-6,500, FHA insured, built for speculation and sold. South of 108th to 111th, east of Rockwell, the area is somewhat older with a miscellaneous lot of old frames and low-priced brick bungalows. Due to the cemetery on the west, values in the area will tend to depreciate. West of Western to Rockwell, south of 111th, is a poor section in process of development, with some fair construction. There is a good Roman Catholic church and school in this area, which gives it a possibility of a future better development as far as Rockwell. 111th Place is an old, declining sectino of frame homes. 111th Street is zoned for business, as well as 95th and 119th. In this Southwest Chicago area, that is; that portion of it between 95th and 119th lying between California and Halsted Street, there is too much property set out for future business development. The adjoining properties are one-family home areas, for the most part, and if more of this had been zoned for apartments, it might have been better. The area north of 103rd between Western and California is platted but not developed. on the south side of 107th at Rockwell is a manufacturing insulating plant. The oldest part of this area is from 109th to 113th. Going west on 107th from Western Avenue to Artesian, one block north and south is vacant. Some new brick bungalows are encountered west of Rockwell, and California is more or less vacant. Campbell Street north from 111th has much vacant property with some two and three-story apartments, and a few single brick bungalows which start at 109th- the street here is unpaved. The new construction is on the west side. At 108th on the east, Campbell has poor frame and cheap construction brick bungalows- on the west side, however, the construction of brick bungalows is of a more substantial character. Artesian Street is a poor one- considerable vacant property and a poor class of old brick and frame home. South of 111th is unpaved. Maplewood going south from 107th and 109th, on the west side, is vacant- the east side has some new brick bungalow construction. The street here is unpaved. North on Talman from 109th, there is considerable vacant property on the east side and on the west are brick bungalows of old construction. At 108th new brick bungalows appear, the east side being vacant. On Washtenaw Street, going south from 107th to 108th, vacant property if on the west side and on the east, brick and frame bungalows. At 109th, homes of older construction of mixed frame, brick and stucco with a few two-flats. Mount Greenwood Cemetery lies to the west. On Fairfield Street there is also much vacant property, the cemetery influence to the west undoubtedly is detrimental. On Maplewood south of 111th, there area few two-family flats. Facing Kennedy Memorial Park, the district between 111th and 115th is known as the old Iglehart district, construction being old-style brick and frame homes. On Western between 112th Place and 113th Place, on the east side, is the Washington Adams Smith Home for elderly people- then mostly small frame bungalows. Future trend in this area is unpromising.

Halsted Street, a main thoroughfare running north and sotuh, with much vacant land for one-half block on either side, has recently had installed a large sewer built from public funds. East of Halsted is a section known as the Fernwood District. Transportation in this area has not been good, but recently a new bus line has been opened on Halsted Street, and also on 95th Street at the north, and since this has occurred, there has been more interest taken in this area. Present indications are that it will develop slowly. There have been no assessments for some years, but there are many unpaid from former years. North of 99th Street the area is quite sparsely settled. East of Vincennes is approximately one-half restricted to Whites, and property lying east of Vincennes Avenue is somewhat more difficult to move than that lying on the west. Practically all homes on Halsted north from 103rd Street are frame. On Peoria between 96th and 99th Streets are a number of brick bungalows; continuing south of 101st Street frames predominate (over) and south of 102nd Street bricks predominate again. On Sangamon, north of 103rd, are many brick singles. There is much vacant property between 101st and 100th Streets. Lots are mostly 25 foot. Development of this area should be somewhat better from now on due to improved transportation and the fact that the large sewer on Halsted Street is now in.

Church Street, south of Monterey, is an assortment of small frame bungalows constructed many years ago; and from Chelsea south on Church, the development turns into old, small frame houses.

There is a sizeable overhang in the area, and a slight tendency on the part of institutions to dump properties, although no wholesale instance of this has occurred as yet. Lawrence and Kedzie are the main shopping streets, but many of the stores are typical fish markets and shoe-string business operations. One reason for the good rentals obtainable is because of excellent elevated transportation ending at Lawrence and Kimball. The higher-priced rentals quoted above in most cases have one and one-half baths. The experience of many institutions in the area is that tenants move very often and considerable reconditioning must be done at least one a year. The grading of the area is penalized because of the class of occupancy, and a very marked downward trend.","9":"Albany Park 3rd C-55 ","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Middle class and lower middle class","1c":"75% Jewish","1d":"","1e":"Lower class Jewish","2a":"Two family; 5-6 rooms Three-family; 5-6 rooms","2b":"Brick Brick","2c":"17-25 years 17-25 years","2d":"Fair- some fairly good Fair- some fairly good","2e":"98% 98%","2f":"50% 50%","2g":"$6,000-8,500 $8,000-13,000","2h":"$7,000-10,000 17+ $9,500-15,000 17+","2i":"(1939-Sept.) $6,500-9,000 9- (1939-Sept.) $8,500-13,500 10-","2j":"Fair- up to $8,250 Fair- up to $11,500","2k":"Weak Weak","2l":"$45.00-62.50 $45.00-62.50","2m":"$50.00-70.00 12+ $50.00-70.00 12+","2n":"(1939-Sept.) $50.00-70.00 December 30, 1899 (1939-Sept.) $50.00-70.00 December 30, 1899","2o":"Good- up to $60.00 Good- up to $60.00","2p":"Firm Firm *3rd column on page, unsure where to put information","4a":"February 9, 1900","4b":"200 units","5a":"February 20, 1900","5b":"February 28, 1900"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.689066,41.979594],[-87.689237,41.978206],[-87.689236,41.978155],[-87.689285,41.978135],[-87.689037,41.968718],[-87.689035,41.968646],[-87.692223,41.968726],[-87.692294,41.971271],[-87.692245,41.971271],[-87.692247,41.971341],[-87.691196,41.971341],[-87.691973,41.972622],[-87.694077,41.972649],[-87.694184,41.973418],[-87.696679,41.973444],[-87.696786,41.975273],[-87.696735,41.975273],[-87.696739,41.975344],[-87.692295,41.975344],[-87.692298,41.975769],[-87.692648,41.979581],[-87.692594,41.97958],[-87.689113,41.979524],[-87.689116,41.979595],[-87.689066,41.979594]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C56","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"75% 20%","3":"December 30, 1899  ","5":"","6":"Limited","7":" ","8":"This is a mediocre neighborhood of old frame houses with a few scattered brick two-family units some of which have stone fronts.

This has been prdeominantly Jewish for 10 to 15 years, and the continuing infiltration is occurring, but those families coming in now are of a lower class than those already in the neighborhood. It is a typical Jewish section with the children playing all over the street, and properties generally showing lack of respect by tenants. It is significant to note that many of the buildings which are now owned by Jews are now being forced into the market very sharply, and other institutional owners have instituted a policy of cutting prices and considering any offer of a reasonable nature. Prices on all classes of one to four-family houses have broken during the past two years, and are still below 1935 level, although it is generally believed that prices on income-producing properties will remain fairly firm during the next six to twelve months. In spite of the fact that this section has excellent transportation, very good shopping facilities and is convenient to the beach, the fact that is is practically 80 per cent Jewish limits its appeal to other than this class of resident, and it is most doubtful that any reversal of the present down trend can be expected. About 65 per cent of the buildings are large apartments renting for $12 per room. The maintenance cost on multiple units are so high that buildings produce practically no return on investment. The three-family structures are valued from $10,000-12,000; renting $50-65.","9":"Rogers Park 3rd C-68 Oct. 1939","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Middle class","1c":"80% Jewish","1d":"0%","1e":"Lower class Jewish","2a":"One-family; 6-9 rooms Two & three-family; 5-6 rooms","2b":"Frame- few brick Brick","2c":"20-40 years 20-40 years","2d":"Fair- some poor Fair","2e":"100% 97%","2f":"40-45% 40%","2g":"$5,500-11,000 $8,500-11,500","2h":"$5,500-11,000 December 30, 1899 $8,500-11,500 December 30, 1899","2i":"(1939-Oct.) $5,000-10,000 10- (1939-Oct.) $7,500-10,000 12-","2j":"Poor- up to $8,000 Good to fair- up to $8,500","2k":"Weak Firm","2l":"$37.50-60.00 $45.00-60.00","2m":"$40.00-65.00 8+ $50.00-65.00 9+","2n":"(1939-Oct.) $40.00-65.00 December 30, 1899 (1939-Oct.) $50.00-65.00 December 30, 1899","2o":"Good- up to $60.00 Good- up to $60.00","2p":"Firm Firm","4a":"January 7, 1900","4b":"","5a":"January 4, 1900","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.66264,42.015236],[-87.662377,42.014651],[-87.662086,42.014478],[-87.661853,42.014067],[-87.66197,42.013677],[-87.661678,42.013309],[-87.661707,42.012747],[-87.66162,42.012249],[-87.661329,42.011837],[-87.661299,42.011404],[-87.661066,42.01082],[-87.660484,42.010279],[-87.660047,42.009651],[-87.659697,42.008482],[-87.660775,42.008504],[-87.660192,42.00688],[-87.659784,42.005776],[-87.659464,42.004412],[-87.659522,42.002767],[-87.65961,42.001338],[-87.659765,42.001092],[-87.659975,42.000758],[-87.661568,42.001624],[-87.661762,42.004106],[-87.662229,42.006849],[-87.662772,42.008696],[-87.66421,42.011842],[-87.665297,42.013516],[-87.665958,42.015883],[-87.66724,42.019664],[-87.667389,42.020993],[-87.665932,42.021058],[-87.664155,42.015344],[-87.66264,42.015236]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C69","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"25% 10%","3":"December 30, 1899  ","5":"","6":"Ample 70%- 10 years","7":" ","8":"This Lake Shore frontage on Sheridan Road section was at one time one of the most desirable residential sections in Rogers Park.

The Indian Harbor Belt Line Railroad terminates here and has yards and shops just south of the residential development. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific R.R. also passes from east to west though the town, and the Soo Line R.R. cuts the village at the eastern portion.

The village has a good high school at the north end and there are grammar schools availabel as well. Shopping facilities are only mediocre, and many residents avail themselves of the excellent shopping centers in Oak Park about 3 miles south. Shortly after the development of Franklin Park many lots were sold to outsiders seeking speculative possibilities. Following hte panic of 1894, the developers took back a large number of these lots and (over) sicne then taxes have piled up, as well as general and special assessments, so that development has been retarded as a result. There is a small steel wire mill at the edge of the residential district at King and Eddington St. This company probably employs around 75 wage earners. There is a small industrial section lying just south of Grand Ave. along the Soo Line tracks. This, however, has only a sligth affect upon the residential area.

The area is at least 45 or 50 years old, and is strictly a residential one of a conglomerated mixture of almost every conceivable type of home. Occupied by people of very moderate means with an average income of those employed of $1,500 per year. There are no manufacturing industries and during the depression many people were on relief in this section. It is one of the sections of Chicago where there are no building restricttinos against framehomes. During the last few years sewers and pavement have been put in by public funds. This absorbed many laborers living on relief, and has been the means of improving the section with some new frame construction of inferior type. The trend of this new building is between Kedzie Avenue and the Ridge Country Golf Club between 103rd and 108th where about two dozen new 1 1/2 and 2 story frames have been built of cheap construction. At 108th there are a few scattered new homes among the very old ones, all very inferior. North of 111th, west of Homan for a few blocks are about 24 new frame homes scattered throughout the area as far north as 108th, nearly all 1 and 1 1/2 frame, on all sizes of lots, and (over) different types of construction; throughout the entire area there are only a few moderate brick homes. There is a new public school recently constructed on the east side of Homan and between 108th and 109th. On 108th east of Homan and west of Kedzie is much vacant property. South of 115th on Homan is a somewhat better grade of home of mixed frame construction. South of 111th on Kedzie, an old part of the area, are some very old homes without basements built on posts. The whole area is on level prairie land. The main street running north and south is Kedzie. The area can be considered to be without much future and one where people go in order to obtain a cheap home over their heads. Situated about 13 miles south of the Loop immediately south of Evergreen Park, the Ridge Country Golf Club lies to the northeas, and adjoining to the east are Mount Greenwood and Mount Olivet Cemeteries, and to the southeast Mount Hope Cemetery.

West of Yates Avenue, and north of Brainard Avenue is some new development. The future of the community looks somewhat better. The Pressed Steel Car Company, a subsidiary of the General American Tank Car Company, has recently purchased the Bus Division of the Gar Wood Industries of Detroit, Michigan, and are moving this industry to Hegewisch. The development along Lake Calumet will also help the community. The trend of new constructino will be directly east of the Ford Plant located east of Torrence Avenue to the northeast of Hegewisch. The future of the town depends entirely on the industrial barometer. About 80 per cent of the foreign population is Polish. During the depression all industries thereto were closed down completely. Due to its proximity to Hammond Indiana, where there is no sales taxed, much business is lost to Hegewisch.","9":"So.

For several years the Pressed Steel Car Co. and the Ryan Car Co., to the north, were idle, and the village suffered considerably.

There is not a vacant house in the territory, and occupancy, moreover, is about 150 per cent, for most houses have more than one family living in them. Sales have been very good where liberal financing terms are available, but on other sales mortgage financing is virtually impossible to obtain. This concentration of negroes in Evanston is quite a serious problem for the town as they seem to be growing steadily and encroaching into adjoining neighborhoods. The two family structures are in most cases converted singles and they likewise are overflowing with occupants; these buildings are rented as unheated units. The number of persons on relief in this district is probably heavier than in any other area long the north shore. Altho the area is probably heavier than the class of occupants already here, it is difficult to say that the section is declining, for it is in constant demand because of the limited number of areas available for negro occupancy in the north shore towns.","9":"Evanston, Ill. 4th D-2 Jan. 1940","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Servant class- relief","1c":"5% Italian","1d":"90%","1e":"Negro","2a":"One family- 5-6 rooms Two family- 4-5 rooms","2b":"Frame- stucco Frame- stucco","2c":"20-25 years 20-25 years","2d":"Poor to fair Poor to fair","2e":"100-150% 100%","2f":"50% 25%","2g":"$2,000-3,500 $4,000-6,000","2h":"$2,500-4,500 17+ $4,000-6,000 December 30, 1899","2i":"$2,500-4,500 December 30, 1899 $4,000-6,000 December 30, 1899","2j":"Good- $4,000 Good","2k":"Firm Firm","2l":"$25.00-30.00 $25.00-30.00","2m":"$25.00-30.00 December 30, 1899 $25.00-30.00 December 30, 1899","2n":"$25.00-30.00 December 30, 1899 $25.00-30.00 December 30, 1899","2o":"Good Good","2p":"Firm Firm","4a":"None","4b":"Few","5a":"January 8, 1900","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.874083,41.880089],[-87.872741,41.88],[-87.872771,41.87646],[-87.878178,41.87635],[-87.878297,41.878296],[-87.882902,41.87823],[-87.883139,41.881039],[-87.877346,41.88115],[-87.877376,41.880309],[-87.874083,41.880089]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"D20","holc_grade":"D","area_description_data":{"2":"N/A ","3":"December 30, 1899  ","5":"","6":"Difficult","7":" ","8":"This area lies along the Chicago, Aurora, & Elgin Railroad in the western portion of Bellwood.

Population is largely lower class Polish, but there is a marked infiltration of Italian from the district to the south, and the future of the area appears even less secure than it is today. The new subway, which is under construction at the present time, will run out Milwaukee Ave. and reduce (over) the transportation time to the loop to approximately five minutes, whereas, it is now about twenty. This may have a favorable effect on property values, but it is most doubtful that it will ever be of sufficient importance to favorably affect trend of desirability in the neighborhood or attract a better class population. Milwaukee Ave. is a commercial street throughout its entire length, and, as such, is considered a fair business section. The best local shopping center is on Chicago Avenue, between Ashland and Damen. Because of its mixed character and the disrepair of most properties, the district is most unattractive to other than lower-income groups and it is, therefore, graded fourth class, with the further comment that it will be even poorer during the coming years. It is somewhat questionable whether this would be an advisable place for a slum clearance project.","9":"Chicago 4th D-29 Mar. 1940","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Lower class- laborers- clerks- \"reliefers\"","1c":"60% Polish- 10% Jewish","1d":"0%","1e":"Italian","2a":"2&3 family 4-5-6 rms.

Altho the district is predominantly residential , there is considerable small and large business scattered throughout. The section has no future and that portion south of Division St. is very definitely blighted. The blight is extending north to that point and may be expected to eventually envelop the entire territory. Housing accommodations are, in most cases, little more than minimum shelter and many units have no inside baths. In addition to the residential properties noted above, there are a number of old-fashioned 6 and 8-flat units, which gives the territory a most heterogeneous appearance. In some cases there are two buildings on the same lot, one of course being an alley property. Negro population is largely concentrated south of Division St., and west of Wells St., but a continued infiltration of this race has caused an overflow north of that point; and it is reasonable to assume that the section may eventually become more negro than Italian, which is the other predominating population class residing in this section today. (over) The area is highly congested; streets are dirty and alleys are strewn with refuse. There is a very heavy traffic flow both north and south, and east and west. Industrial encroachment from the south and west will probably gradually decrease the size of this section from a residential standpoint. A Government housing project is planned for the two blocks west of Sedgwick, running from Chicago to Division. A private housing projected erected by the Marshall Field Estate, which occupies the ground between Evergreen St. and Blackhawk St., one block west of Sedgwick, has been comparatively successful, although rents in these buildings are not competitive with surrounding properties. Trend of desirability, from a residential point of view, continues steadily downward; but, because of the favorable location of the district from the point of accessibility to employment centers, this should be a logical place for further slum clearance projects.

Many old brick, stone, and some frame homes, averaging 60 years, 7-15 rooms, converted into rooming houses. Area is somewhat uniform in type as to class of residences and multi-family. Residences command a better rental bracket than 2's and 3's, due to size and number of rooms; and residential values are firmer than in adjoining area. Little difference exists in values between residences and 2's and 3's, due to adaptability of large homes for use as rooming houses. The Crane Technical School is at Jackson, Van Buren, Oakley and Bell. Jackson Blvd, east from Western Ave., is composed almost entirely of brick and stone residences converted, some 2's and 3's; and becomes lower-grade east of Damen. Part walls exist. Interspersed throughout the area are light manufacturing industries and small retail business stores. On Congress are many brick part walls, a few singles converted, spotted with light manufacturing. West of Wood are a number of 3's, party walls, interspersed with busienss, few frames. Leavitt Street, north of Adams, is exceptionally poor; mixed, singles of brick and 2's and 3's. On Monroe Street, west from Leavitt, are brick and stone residences converted; party walls; many commerical houses. A fair to good demand exists for rooming houses, both for rent and purchase. Much vandalism appears, although some buildings are boarded up. Wieboldt Store, a large chain department store, is at Ogden, Ashland, Monroe and Adams. A cheaper grade of rooming house is east of Ashland; and on Monroe, east of Loomis, are many light manufacturing industries. The area is level; rapidly deteriorating; blighted; and composed of a mixed population. University Hospital is on the northwest corner of Winchester and Congress; and south of Congress, on Winchester to Polk, east to Wood, north to Congress, west to Honore, is located the Presbyterian Hospital, Cook County Hospital, Illinois Research Hospital, University of Illinois Medical School, Rush Medical School and Loyola University Medical School. Sales turnover are fairly active; but, only on long term purchases, 10 per cent down, or $200 or $300 cash. That section west of Ogden is somewhat better than east.

A Nurses' Home, a large, pretentious building, is at Polk and Lincoln; and at Wolcott and Polk is the State Medical School of Illinois University.

Rush Medical College is at Harrison and Wood; and a proposition, still alive, exists to turn that portion of the area between Leavitt and Paulina, West Congress to West Roosevelt, into a huge medical center. This would materially assist the surrounding properties, as it would mean the establishment of parks, apartment buildings, and business houses, etc. A few hospitals already in the area are the Cook County Hospital, University Hospital, Presbyterian Hospital, and Loyola University Medical School. The area is one that will continue to be a problem, unless demolishment and rehabilitation becomes a fact. Age and obsolescence is such that no private money for development purposes will come into the section.

Majority of people are on relief. The area is rapidly deteriorating; badly blighted; and colored expansion is expected to continue north and west. Many demolishments are scattered throughout; also, a number of buildings boarded up. Very little difference exists in price values between 2's and 3's, the 2's being more popular. Property owners who can dispose of their properties to the colored element move west; those who cannot, rent. The Illinois State University Hospital and School of Medicine is located between Taylor and Polk, Wood to Damen. North of Polk is the Cook County Hospital; the Cook County Nurses' Home (exclusively for nurses) lies between Winchester and Lincoln, Polk to Harrison. These buildings adjoin the area and compose what is known as a medical and dental district. Demolishments and medical buildings have thwarted the negro's growth in this particular section. The only hope for this blighted colored area is a few more Jane Adams Projects; or demolishment and rehabilitation on a large scale, undertaken by the city, county or federal authorities in (over) conjunction with owners. The Jane Adams Project, located north of the area between Racine and Loomis, is highly spoken of; but is only a \"flea-bite\" when compared with the large blighted district surrounding it. In the eastern end of the area is the Maxwell Street open-air market, called the \"Ghetto\", which runs for about three blocks east of Halsted. Some attempt is being made to regulate this eye-sore and encourage more sanitary measures; little evidence appears today of this object being attained. East of Ashland are a few white families of Irish and Polish extraction. Damen Street is exceedingly poor. North on Paulina from Roosevelt are colored families on the east. 13th Street, east of Racine, is badly blighted, a mixture of all sorts of buildings, mostly brick 2's and 3's. No mortgage money available anywhere; also few steam-heated rooms. Whenever a residential vacancy exists, vandalism immediately occurs on a large scale, with little or no interference. Years ago this area was all Irish, supplnated by Jews, who gave way to Italians, followed by colored, Mexicans, Greeks, etc. At present, the Chicago Housing Authority is engaged in checking the territory nort of the Jane Adams Project and another project, still alive, hopes to interest city, county, state and private enterprise, inclusing the Mayo Brothers, Rochester, toward the development of a large medical center which would lie between Leavitt and Paulina, Congress and Roosevelt Road. This would mean the demolishment and rehabilitation of a great portion of the area, replaced by hospitals, nurses' homes, attendant retail business establishments, apartment buildings, parks, etc. In this area are the University of Chicago Hospital, the Presbyterian Hospital, the Senn Memorial Hospital, the Loyola University School of Medicine, Rush Medical Laboratories, Chicago College of Dental Surgery, the Rockefeller-McCormick Institue, etc.; and in addition, many churches and other institutions. People in the area live from day to day; many have no money to bury members of their family and collections for funerals are not infrequent. This blighted area will continue to be an increasing menace.","9":"Southwest Chicago 4th D-40 Jan. 1940","1a":"Yes  ","1b":"Relief, WPA, Laborers, low wage-earners","1c":"N/A ","1d":"100%","1e":"As above","2a":"Single cottages- 5-6R Two and three-flats","2b":"Brick and frame Brick","2c":"50-60 years 55 years","2d":"Poor Poor","2e":"90% 80%","2f":"50% 50%","2g":"$1,500-2,000 (2)- $2,500-3,500; (3)- $3,000-3,750","2h":"$1,500-2,000 December 30, 1899 Same as 1935 December 30, 1899","2i":"$1,500-2,000 December 30, 1899 Same as 1937 December 30, 1899","2j":"Poor Fair.

Railroad tracks and industry are along the entire northern boundary and much industry also is located at the southeast; the National Lead Company is located at Peoria and 18th. $3,500 is approximately the top limit for any kind of property; anyone able to pay more goes west. The future of the of the entire blighted area is discouraging; population is decreasing; there is no immigration of foreigners. The younger element, through the use of our educational facilities, obtain a good education and ultimately obtain positions outside to the area. They talk the English language and, as they grow into manhood and womanhood and marry, have no desire to live here, preferring to either rent or buy in the better white sections of the city. The older people, who still talk their native language, do not wish to leve; although, in some case, the younger people have induced them to sell and go along with them. This has not been proven to be (over) satisfactory. The result is that only negro, Mexican, or the low-class white will move in; and these have no money. The future of this area is hopeless, unless by cooperation of the city and county authorities with property owners, some housing projects may be originated and completed, and part of the area rehabilitated through necessary demolishments. These foreigners, having raised their families, now find themselves in the positino of being unable to sell, even if they desired to. Almost every foreign nationality is represented in this section. Throughout the entire area, considerable vandalism occurs. On 19th Street, east from Western, is a mixture of many kinds of buildings; brick and stone, all in poor condition; although, it is noted that the Poles and Bohemians heep their properties up better than the Italians do in their area. Many homes and flats are built below the street level. There are a few party walls in this area. An old quarry, located between 18th and 19th, Lincoln and Wood, is used as a garbage dumping ground and, in summer, the odors from this are extremely offensive. 19th Street, east of Blue Island, becomes somewhat better, with many brick singles, 2s and 3's.

Between the streets and the building lots are rather deep drainage ditches with stagnant water standing in many places. These ditches are so deep that in some instances acess to the houses is by planks laid from the road across the ditch to the building lot. There are some very old, frame houses mixed in type, with an occasional good brick bungalow. Maintenance is poor for the most part and the area as shown on the map as developed would probably not be more than 30% built up. There are many lots where cultivation on a small scale has been attempted with growing of corn and vegetables; stray chickens, goats; fodder shocks and hay stacks, all (over) within the confines of the village. There are no transportation facilities, which however, is no detriment to the class of population living here, most of whom as mentioned above, work in the Soo Line shop and yards.

Single homes are of the 6-10 room type, average age 40 years. In this area under construction is the Ida B. Wells US Housing Project, extending from 37th to 39th between South Parkway and Cottage Grove. This proejct is expected to house 1,662 negro families and, of course, will be taken off the tax rolls with the exception of taxes for police, fire and school purposes. This venture has the realtors guessing as to what the ultimate result will be when so many of this race are drawn into this section from the already negro-blighted district; particularly its effect on the section east and south of Cottage Grove, and to park and water frontage on Lake Michigan. Already Washington Park at the south, a very fine park, has been almost completely monopolized by the colored race. Criticism is heard of the locatino of the proejct, some believing it should have been located north of Oakwood and west of Indiana in order to keep the colored influence as far as possible from further encroaching on park and lake water frontage. Others believe that a location south of 35th, extending (over) to Garfield Boulevard between State and the Rock Island RR, would have been preferably and a large fire hazard eliminated; property adjoining the railroad used as a playground, and landscaped with trees, shrubs, etc. NOTE: At the southeast corner of South Parkway and 60th, a brick apartment house of at least 24 flats in a restrited area is reported as owned by Joe Louis. * A small colored B&L organization, the Illinois Federal B&L, is located at 62 E. 47th St. *Three's on South Parkway and Michigan Avenue would run up to $10,000. A remodeling of buildings, stores, etc., by property owners on State Street would have resulted; and the cost of the project less. Rooms in a housing project should be in keeping with the average pockets of the neighborhood, which is said to be from $4.50 to $5.00 per room. With approximately 6,500 colored people moving into this district, it is evident they cannot be closed in; they must have an outlet; and the problem of keeping park and water frontage close by reasonably free of them will be difficult to surmount. The trend of the colored people will no be accelerated toward this park and water frontage, which many people consider could have been avoided had it been located west of Indiana. That section of the area between 35th and 39th, Cottage Grove to Lake Park Avenue, is restricted to whites; but, there are a number of colored families on Ellis Avenue between 37th and 35th, and it is believed (particularly since the advent of the housing project) that this entire section will ultimately go colored, which will increase the number of colored people using the lake front. Washington Park is already doomed. Throughout the entire area aer many vacant lots for which there is no market, due in part to the class of inhabitant and age of improvements. Rehabilitation also is a negligible factor. Instead of demolishing or rehabilitating some of these properties, it might be better to dispose of them than increase vacant property which has little value today. An organization known as the Hyde-Park-Kenwood Protective Organization is endeavoring to keep that section south of 35th to Pershing, east of Cottage Grove (which is restricted) white; but, with at least 25 colored families already in, white people hesitate to buy or rent- colored people will. South of 35th to Marquette, east of State, homes and flats are of a better type; also a better class of colored inhabitant. On Michigan, south of 55th are a number of large, 3-story, brick construction residences. On South Parkway, between 61st and 63rd east to Cottage Grove, are some large apartment buildings being taken over by colored people. Between 66th and Marquette, east of State, is a small section of comparatively good brick bungalows and 2's, some frames. Here a better class of colored people reside. There is nothing for sale or rent, and many applicants for both. This section is fairly old, however. Washington Park on the southeast of the area is almost 90 per cent used by negroes. It is one of the better city parks, with good swimming pools. The pools are so popular in summer time that the colored children are allowed in for one hour only at a time, when a new shift occurs. At South Parkway and 45th is a substantial new building being erected to hosue the Metropolitan Funeral Parlors and Insurance Organizations- all colored. The first settlement of the colored people was south of 22nd to 47th, west of State to Wentworth. The next movement was west of Michigan, where they joined forces at State. Michigan Avenue and South Parkway were the last to go colored about 15 years ago. The rapid development in South Chicago in the 20's of new subdivisions, homes, apartments, etc., caused a vacation of buildings on a large scale, and colored people moved in. The Stockyard Boom during the war is estimated to have brought in about 10,000 families from the South; and in the area at present under discussion, together with adjoining area, is a colored population estimated between 300,000 and 350,000. South of Washington Park sales of properties are said to be taking place to Jews and others, who hold title and rent to colored families. No mortgage money available north of 63rd, between Cottage Grove and Halsted. One of the problems is to find means of helping these people aid themselves. Already colored people are in various businesses, but the majority of the business is controlled by Jews. Our contract broker exhibited a list of approximately 500 applications at present on file from responsible colored people looking for homes to purchase; and no matter how small a flat is, it is usually rented to from eight people and up, who sleep in shifts.* If a responsible mortgage corporation, building and loan or otherwise, composed of colored people could be established it would aid rehabilitation and the turnover of all properties. Property values and rents have increased since 1935 an estimated 30 per cent, but only to colored people. Large apartment buildings are located on Michigan, Indiana, Prairie, Calume and South Parkway south of 47th; also north of Washington Park between Cottage Grove and South Parkway, between 43rd and 51st, with a sprinkiling of singles. 2's, 3's and 6's are located on Wabash, Indiana, Prairie and Calumet between 35th and 63rd. On the corners are the larger buildings; at Wabash and Garfield is the Schulte Bakery (Butternut Bread) industry. Transportation good. The center of this huge colored area is located att 47th and South Parkway. From this hub the colored business activity radiates. It is believed that, unless various rel estate protective associations are strong enough to restrict the colored people, ultimately they will spread over that territory east of Cottage Grove between 39th and 47th. Between 35th and 55th, along South Parkway (formerly Grand Boulevard) are many high-grade residences and apartments. At one time many of Chicago's elite presided here. At Bowen Avenue and Cottage Grove was located the first Walgreen Drug store organization. At 49th and South Parkway is the Corpus Christi Catholic Church, at one time a wealthy, high-grade parish, now ministering almost entirely to colored people. At 61st and Michigan is the St. Columbanus Catholic church, to which the same has happened; and again a similar experience has happened to the Holy Angels Catholic church on Oakwood and Vincennes. At 39th and Hampden is a large apartment building with over 100 apartments. A bad section of the area exists between 51st and 59th on Calumet and Prairie, where the moral influence is far from good. It is emphasized that one of the most important necessities is to provide a means of financing these colored homes so that they may be rehabilitated; provide a larger turnover of property; and hold these people within the area.

In THE CHICAGO SUNDAY TRIBUNE of October 15 was a news report which read: \"The Supreme Corut of Illinois on October 10 handed down an opinion which sustains the restrictions in force against Negro occupancy and ownership in the old Washington Park sub-division, between 60th and 63rd Streets and Cottage Grove and South Park Avenues. It also affirmed injunctions restraining a white owner from selling or leasing his property to a colored family.\" (See reverse) Located 60-63 between Cottage Grove & South Park Avenue.","9":"Woodlawn D March 18, 1900 October 1, 1939","1a":" Yes ","1b":"Laborers, low class wage earners","1c":"December 30, 1899 Swedes and Jewish","1d":"December 30, 1899","1e":"Negroes, Jews, Swedes","2a":"2-3 flats; 6-7 rooms 6 flats; 6-7 rooms","2b":"Brick and stone Brick and stone","2c":"30-40 years 30-40 years","2d":"Fair Fair","2e":"December 30, 1899 December 30, 1899","2f":"December 30, 1899 December 30, 1899","2g":"(2fl) $5,000-5,800; (3fl) $5,500-7,250 $10,750-15,000","2h":"(2fl) $4,500-5,250 (3fl) $5,000-6,500  $9,500-13,500 ","2i":"(1939) (2fl) $4,500-5,250; (3fl) $5,000-6,500  (1939) $9,500-13,500 ","2j":"Poor Poor","2k":"Down Down","2l":"$37.50-50.00 $37.50-50.00","2m":"$35.00-45.00  $35.00-45.00 ","2n":"(1939) $35.00-45.00  (1939) $35.00-45.00 ","2o":"Poor Poor","2p":"Down Down","4a":"January 3, 1900","4b":"","5a":"January 4, 1900","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.600516,41.773155],[-87.60555,41.773166],[-87.605707,41.780302],[-87.599675,41.780419],[-87.599575,41.77692],[-87.600673,41.776899],[-87.600516,41.773155]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"D79","holc_grade":"D","area_description_data":{"2":"December 30, 1899 December 30, 1899","3":"None  ","5":"","6":"Limited @ 6% due to surroundings","7":" ","8":"The area has excellent transportation both by Elevated, Surface Lines, and Illinois Central.

It has been on the down grade for some time. An effort, however, is being made by improvement clubs, bankers, and brokers to prevent further decline. Captains have been appointed to many blocks in an endeavor to instill a pride of ownership and see what can be done toward painting and rehabilitating some of these old homes which, in the case of frame, average 50 yrs., and brick 35. There are colored people two blocks to the north. Between Ashland and Racine, between 71st and 74th (which is the younger section) 95 per cent are single homes; 80 per cent frame, with many large apartments of 6-24 units scattered throughout on the corners. Many old frames in the area are being converted into 2-family homes. Between 63rd and 74th, Ashland to Racine, 98 per cent are owner-occupied. There are some brick 3's of somewhat newer constructinon in the price bracket of $7,000. Many homes are of brick construction, some built below the street. Between 63rd and 75th, Halsted to Racine, conditions are somewhat similar to the aforesaid, with the exception that there are about a dozen colored families on Carpenter and Aberdeen between 65th and 66th- very spotted. Between 64th and 67th, Stewart to Yale, is probably the best residential district in the area, with some frames as high as $8,000. Large apartment construction in the area was stopped during depression, but is expected to be resumed. Something drastic ultimately must be done. The area should be rebuilt with better homes; there are numbers of them of cheap construction which can easily be demolished. East of Wentworth to State is somewhat identical as to (over) type of building. The better part of the area east of Wallace is adjacent to Hamilton Park between 71st and 74th. The consistently best street in the whole area is Halsted Avenue. Eggleston, north from 65th, has many frame singles, 60-70 years old, very spotted. At 69th and Ashland are big streetcar barns and yards- detrimental. Section aaround 71st Pl., 72nd, and 72nd Pl., and 73rd, west of Racine to Ashland, presents a somewhat better appearance. Schewbridge Field, a large play field, lies south of 74th east of Racine. Stewart Street, south of 74th, as many old apartments. On the east side, between 74th and 73rd, are many party-wall buildings, with brick both in front and rear and frame in the middle. Many poor shacks on this street. South on Lowe from 63rd are coal yards. On 66th, west of Wallace, are many row houses, spotted with mixed constructino. Morgan Street, going north from 69th to 63rd, has recently been widened and an entire new street put down. Many poor frames. The street is now a high-speed highway- detrimental. 63rd and Halsted is said to be the busiest business district in Chicago outside of the Loop. On the west side of Loomis, facing Ogden Park, are some fair homes, with a few two's. This entire area is extremely spotted with old construction of all kinds, with a decidedly poor general, congested appearance. About 75 per cent of the district are two's, many of these 6-7 rooms. Around Normal Parkway are better grade homes and apartments with a better rent bracket. The section south of 75th, east of Harvard to State, is somewhat better than some parts of the area.

Racial concentration, mixed architectural types, poor construction, and lack of conveniences indicate fourth grade.","9":"South Side (Chicago) D April 6, 1900 December 1, 1939","1a":"Yes  ","1b":"Mail carriers- laborers- pullman porters","1c":"December 30, 1899 ","1d":"December 30, 1899","1e":"Slowly from colored sections to north","2a":"Detached singles 5-6 rooms ","2b":"Brick ","2c":"18 years ","2d":"Fair- some poor ","2e":"December 31, 1899 ","2f":"December 31, 1899 ","2g":"$2,600-4,750 ","2h":"$2,750-5,000   ","2i":"(1939-Dec.) $3,000-5,500 (excluding the new construction)   ","2j":"Good to $5,500 ","2k":"Firm ","2l":"Not a ","2m":"Rent   ","2n":"District   ","2o":" ","2p":" ","4a":"December 31, 1899","4b":"December 30, 1899","5a":"1;0","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-87.585434,41.729482],[-87.585334,41.726907],[-87.578408,41.727028],[-87.576834,41.727056],[-87.576649,41.725204],[-87.585134,41.725214],[-87.585206,41.724192],[-87.586774,41.724235],[-87.586774,41.723564],[-87.587601,41.723586],[-87.587772,41.724703],[-87.590411,41.729471],[-87.585434,41.729482]]],[[[-87.594709,41.733463],[-87.59459,41.729649],[-87.593402,41.729649],[-87.593432,41.728008],[-87.591292,41.728008],[-87.591322,41.726368],[-87.589896,41.723707],[-87.597591,41.723596],[-87.597621,41.725392],[-87.604157,41.725237],[-87.604008,41.722066],[-87.608762,41.72191],[-87.60897,41.725259],[-87.612743,41.727343],[-87.602612,41.727565],[-87.601863,41.731624],[-87.597739,41.731645],[-87.597888,41.733374],[-87.594709,41.733463]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"D98","holc_grade":"D","area_description_data":{"2":"December 30, 1899 ","3":"December 30, 1899  ","5":"","6":"Limited","7":" ","8":"This is a rather large and spread out area, running east and west along the railroad and industrial section in the vicinity of 94th St. Terrain is generally flat with very few trees. Practically no building restrictions. Schools, churches and shops reasonably convenient. Poorest values are south of 93rd St. in the central portion. The Polish American Alliance owns some properties in here. Only mortgage funds available from neighborhood B&L's at 6 per cent interest, 3 per cent commission, and 60 per cent of the appraisal is \"tops.\" Properties would have to be in good condition to warrant any kind of a loan in this territory. The eastern portion of the area is not quite so heavily populated with foreign element. Railroad influence is adverse to home ownership, as is industrial influence, car barns, round houses, and light steel foundries. Surface car lines on 93rd, Cottage Grove, and Stony Island Ave. Heavy traffic along Stony Island, 95th, and Cottage Grove. Lots are 25' in width, and the area is about 90 per cent built up. Land values range about $15.00 a front foot, and much land here has market value less than the assessment for improvements. Along 93rd, east of Stony Island, rocky outcrops make construction expensive. Very poor future forseen.

These people are substantial and there is evidence of pride of ownership. All utilities are in as well as paved streets, and transportation is good. On the east, however, the area adjoins the worst section of South Chicago. It is a typical industrial area and quite desirable for those who work in adjacent industries. It is quite spotted. There are few vacant lots. It is well built up, but the future development depends entirely upon the industrial barometer. At this time great optimism exists of increased industrial activity due to the war in Europe. The trend of development is to the west in the \"C\" area, both north and south of the tracks.
