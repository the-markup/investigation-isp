","5":"Main thoroughfares: Castleton Ave., Henderson Ave. Protected on north and east by Sailors Snug Harbor, a well maintained home for retired seamen. Inhabitants of area are largely N.Y.C. commuters. Many have bought here beyond their means with homes mortgaged for 90% of their selling price. Despite this fact there have been very few foreclosures up to the present. Probably the highest loan possible to obtain today in this area would be about $7000. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Are only nominally different from what they were in 1938-39 ($8500 to $10,000.) Offering are infrequent inasmuch as this section is well held by a stable class of dwellers and has consistently been regarded as one of the prime spots on Staten Island. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): Rentals have always been in excellent demand here, and available properties are at a premium. There is not a vacant house in this area today. Despite this exceptional demand, prices have not advanced which is entirely consistent with rental experience elsewhere in the borough. Construction in this area is entirely single family, and the few that are rented bring from $75 to $90 a month. General Comments: This is probably the best balanced, most uniform and typically \"A\" area on Staten Island. It is not handicapped by the presence of large homes of the estate class as are some of the hill sections in the saem grade. It is, therefore, better lending territory, and in fact institutions compete for loans here. Surroundings and layout are good and there are no adverse influences present. One new home is under construction, in the southeastern portion but aside from this there has been no new construction during the past year, and the area may be said to be leveling off.

Here are a few very large and expensive estates. Tax valuations were established before the Staten Island land boom of 1923-26 and are accordingly low. A superb location as to scenic advantages. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Recent erection of a large new apartment building on the south side of Victory Boulevard, facing Silver Lake Reservoir has had the effect of stiffening prices somewhat in the immediate vicinity as several old homes stand on potential sites for apartment construction. These sites are all on Victory Blvd., the north boundary of the area, facing Silver Lake Park, Southeast of this boundary the terrain rises sharply, and the interior of the area is built up with large expensive homes. Prices on these have declined somewhat, although the decline is nominal and not supported by any sales. Institutions made few loans in here and have taken very few properties through foreclosure. No demand and no activity. About the minimum price, even in today's market, would be $20,000. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): About $20 a room in the new 65 apartment building on Victory Boulevard facing the Park. This building is nearly filled. Other available rentals are all large single houses which bring from $75 to $100 a month. There are few vacancies in this area which is noteworthy for splendid scenic advantages and convenience to trans-bay transportation. General Comments: New apartment building above mentioned is only new construction. Owners are understood to contemplate further construction of this character and the area is admirably suited therefore. Land valuations here are somewhat lower than elsewhere, which is a further circumstance favoring multi-family construction.","6":"Grymos Hill, Staton Island  A 2","31":"100","32":"","33":"","1a":"Crest pf hill, sloping steeply downward to northwest within the area, and bordered by still steeper slopes downward to east of the area.

","5":"Principal thoroughfares: Clove Rd., Forest Ave., Broadway Quite a number of foreclosures in this area due to the fact that people here generally bought beyond their menas. However, the area should develop rapidly with any economic improvement, due to its favorable location. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Differ very little from 1938-9 levels. New building activity has supported a demand which has been reflected in institutional and HOLC sales. (HOLC at present owns 13, has sold 19).

Details not available on thesesales but prices ranged between $5500 and $8000. Title Guaranty and Trust Company sales have generally been somewhat below market and in sections where they had large holdings the effect of their activity has been felt. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): About the same as 1938-39 with good demand up to $55. Comparatively high percentage of occupancy in this area because of its favorable location. Effects of Defense Activity: There has been considerable activity in the ship yards along the north shore of Staten Island, resulting from defense contracts. However, as yet the real estate market has derived little or no apparent benefit from the increased employment. Many workers commute from Brooklyn and from adjacent New Jersey and as yet have shown little disposition to move to nearby quarters. General Comments: About 25 to 30 new one family homes built last year. These are brick bungalows, and two story houses, principally located in the south part of the area which is high and somewhat undeveloped in a few spots. Prices range from $6500 to $7500 and FHA financing is offered. 10% cash payment required. Some homes have been built to order for owners who have purchased lots from the builder. There is room for further development in this small part and some activity may be expected. Institutions are believed to hold but little property here now.

","5":"Principal highway: Bay St. A small area developed by one of the leading real estate firms of Staten Island. \"Exclusive\". Fenced in on all sides. Bay front along the \"Narrows\" channel to N.Y. harbor. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): About 5% lower than 1938-39. At that time there was no sales in this small and somewhat exclusive area excepting a few new ones built for owners. About a year ago the Corporation sold one in here for $8000, which is regarded rather low to be a typical transaction. The predominating house in this area is of the $10,000 class, with better values near the waterfront and the cheaper houses nearer Bay Street. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): Very few rented in here and prices have not changed since 1938-39 when $90 to $100 was customary. This is essentially a tight little community of home owners of the better class for Staten Island. General Comments: With expansion of military operations in nearby Ft. Wadsworth this is a logical spot for a possible overflow of officers' families not able to secure quarters on the Reservation. The area is too small to be of great importance as there were few foreclosures here and not much property is held by institutions and none by HOLC. It is fenced in on all sides. One drawback consists in the unattractive approach along Bay Street, and also in the fact that poorer neighborhoods with low grade foreign population encircle it excepting for the waterfront and the Military Reservation to the south. Roadways are narrow and there are few sidewalks. Not in the path of future development and may be expected barely to hold its place for the next few years. Two new single family dwellings are now under construction here for owners.

Some streets shown on map leading from blue to red area have not been cut. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Only a nominal decline since 1938. Impossible to trace any actual sales here as the area has been pretty close to static for the past two years. Demand is very slow and a static condition may be predicted, due to topographical condition making construction expensive and difficult. Dwellers here have generally been a good stable class and foreclosures were comparatively few. hence no institutional offerings. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): This was never much of a rental area, single family structures being about 90% owner occupied. Apartments and two-family dwellings constituted only 0% of the structures. Prices have remained firm here and vacancy is not exceeding 5% of rental units. Singles command from $75 to $90; units in multiples from $50 to $65. General comments: Assessed valuations here are proportionally lower than almost any place on Staten Island, being about 60% of market value. This is because of the fact that valuations were established here, on land, prior to the land boom in the early twenties. The area is somewhat handicapped by proximity to very much lower class neighborhoods on the east, and further because of abnormally steep slopes, making access difficult in slippery weather.

","5":"Principal highways: Forest Ave. This area has progressed slowly even during the depression period. Has uniformly good construction, land practically level and favorable for building operation. Sewer and other public improvements present. Room for expansion. Future prosepects favorable, good road connections to all parts, bridges, ferries, etc. Zoning residential with exception of 100' depth from Forest Ave. Sale Prices (Dec.1940): Down about 5% from 1938 levels. Competition of new and cheaper homes, together with price cutting by institutions which had acquired property here accountable for reductions. This area was the scene of a speculative development resulting in some second mortgage transactions which turned out badly in some instances. An active development now going on here which is not calculated to help the market on older homes in the area. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): No perceptible change from 1938-9 levels. Offerings are few and these are readily absorbed at $50 to $65. HOLC has 7 houses in here; all rented. Trend is firm and the area will continue to be good rental territory. General Comments: Impossible to obtain data on comparative sales here. HOLC has sold only one and institutional sales have been very few within the past year. One of the most active developments on Staten Island during the past two years is in the area. About 50 small brick and frame bungalows have been built here during that period, ranging in price up to $6500. The E.J. McCormick Co. has recently completed 20 brick veneer bungalows which are offered with FHA financing, 10% down. A representative of that concern advised that about 80 more are contemplated and land is now being cleared in preparation. In addition to this group, 21 more are to be built by the A.J. Behrens Co. along College Ave. south of Crystal. These also are offered with FHA financing at prices in the $6000 class. However, later development appears slightly inferior to the types which originally went in here and the area may be expected to level off in the near future with completion of the above housing. Demand is said to be somewhat disappointing to the McCormick concern although this has not altered heir plans for the 80 houses mentioned above. Sales have been to a salaried class: firemen, policemen and salesmen traveling for large corporations. So far, none have 'come back'. While the development is not far distant from the shipyards of the north shore, it is worth comment that not an inquirt has been received from that source to date. Desirability decreases somewhat approaching the south boundary, Warchogue Road, which section is somewhat low. The area is further penalized by inadequate transportation and by being entirely surrounded by lower grade neighborhoods.

","5":"Principal highway: Westervelt Ave. Construction expensive due to steep slopes. Tax valuation on land very high- justified for apartment house purposes but too high for successful development of small dwellings. Northeast section of this area is of higher value than the westerly portion. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Only nominally lower than 1938-39 because this was an old area and prices had been hammered down pretty well by offerings of foreclosed property soon after the market crash of 1929. However most of these have been cleared out, and while prices haven't recovered to any extent, there are pretty steady due to proximity to the New York ferry, the best shopping center of Staten Island and to good amusement facilities. Administration offices of the Borough are located here also. Today's prices on singles range generally from $4500 to $9000; two family structures are in little demand and prices would be $6000 to $6500. Not much activity. Trend slowly downward because of age. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): Convenience of location with respect to New York ferries makes this a good rental district for the commuter with moderate income. Rental demand has always been good here and today there are a dearth of available units. Singles bring from $50 to $80, depending on condition and location; units in two family dwelling; $45 to $60; and apartments in modern buildings rent from $70 to $125. General Comments: Best values are along Ft. Hill Circle, the highest point in the area. There are many old houses in this neighborhood for which there is no present demand except at sacrifice prices. Trend is toward apartments. Land is over valued for tax purposes which is another influence away from single family and toward multi-family construction. This is an \"island\" in the middle of a fourth grade area. No new construction is to be seen here and some additional pressure will have to come from the rental market to afford stimulus for apartment house construction which is about the only thing the area is suited for.","6":"New Brighton, Staten Island C+ 1","31":"40","32":"40","33":"20","1a":"Hilly with steep down grade to north and east.

In this area are a few very cheap poorly constructed single houses, relatively much less desirable than the worst of the 2-family units. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): For large old singles (8 to 12 rooms, 40 to 75 years old) about 10% lower than in 1939, with very little demand as it has been experienced that these cannot be remodeled at a profit. Two family structures meet with a better reception here than in some parts of the County less thickly populated with Italian families. Nevertheless, there have been no sales traceable at anywhere near the 1938-39 top figure of $12,000 and this may now be regarded as nominal only. About $8500 would be an average high price for almost anything in the area today. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): About the same as in 1938-39. Very light vacancy here, as elsewhere on Staten Island. Singles in tenantable condition bring from $35 to $50; apartments in 2 family buildings are generally $35 to $45, with very few higher. Conditions have leveled off in the rental market and no immediate change forecast. General Comments: Small cheap one story stores along Bay Street in this vicinity. The neighborhood appears to be going strongly Italian with the almost inevitable down hill trend which usually accompanies influx of this racial group. It may benefit slightly from the anticipated increase in military activity at Ft. Wadsworth but this is rather problematical, and any benefits would likely be indirect inasmuch as the area contains few houses suited for official tenancy. Trend expected to remain somewhat downward. No new construction here during the past year. The Corporation owns a total of 7 houses in the area and has sold 5 in 1940. Institutional holdings are very few.

","5":"Principal highways: Hylan Blvd., Richmond Rd. There were many foreclosures here. As a general rule thje 2-family units were better built than the singles. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Higher priced singles have come down sharply where any sales at all are noted; the house quoted at $7000 in 1938 may be offered at $5500 today. Two family structures have suffered even more; whereas $8500 to $12,000 was mentioned as a fair bracket in 1938, today it would be more like $6000 to $8500, with no demand whatever at the second figure. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): Rents were always pretty low in here, considering property values, and therefore haven't changed noticeably within the past two years. Singles still bring from $20 to $45; apartments in two family dwellings from $40 to $45 heated. Demand is good and there appear to be very few vacancies. General Comments: HOLC has upwards of 40 houses in this area. Many were early foreclosures and have not been reappraised, consequently are priced somewhat higher than competing houses. Few offers are made on property in this area. Property management brokers operating in this area cite instances where the Corporation refused offers two months ago which they are now seeking to revive. Competitors are not selling well in here either; although they have a heavy load at present. Majority of sales are to Italians, who buy sacrifice property in wife's name. No new construction has gone in during the past year and the area is noticeably \"stagnant\", probably because of the racial factor. Institutions have made consecutive reductions of their offerings without apparently having much effect on speeding up liquidation. No future improvement forecast and the trend is downward.

After foreclosure some rented for about $18 a month in 1934 - $25 in 1938.  Area blighted by 20% Sears Roobuck houses; Sales Prices (Dec. 1940): Predominating level today would be somewhere between $4000 and $7500, for single houses which comprise all improvements.  This represents a decrease of $1000 approximately at the upper end of the range.  There is very little demand in here for any sort of housing, least of all for the more expensive ones.  Some improvement foreseen due to a new dual highway which passes through the area from northeast to southwest.  This highway affords more direct connection with the north end of the island, via Richmond Avenue, but more important, it opens up a tract of land containing fine small home sites, wooded and high; Rental prices: About the same as 1938-39 at $30 to $45 for singles.  Demand is good but not exceptional, and there were no vacancies apparent, excepting one HOLC houses about the center of the area; General comments: Street surfaces bad in many parts of the area.  Better values north of the railroad, and the south portion of the area, which is detached, represents the worst portion of all.  A small automobile junk yard is located in this part.  The terrain is low and built up with very old or very small and cheap hosues.  Very slovenly appearance and upkeep.  Poor road surface here expecting for Polion Avenue.  There are a few very small and cheap bungalows along Detroit Avenue in the north part of the area, but these are exceptional in this part.  West of Ramona Boulevard the area is somewhat newer and there are more small brick bungalows and cottages, but the terrain is generally grown up with scrub trees and has not the charm found east of this dividing line.  Also it is more sparsely built up, probably not more than 20 to 25%.  Only one new house was seen in the area, a small frame bungalow near the northwest boundary.  This is one of the areas which stand to benefit greatly by any defense developments along the south shore. Pending at present is decision on a proposed drydock site near the Prince's Bay section.

","5":"Principal highway: Amboy Rd. These are 3 of the oldest villages on Staten Island. Very little change is noted here, with the old native element still in the majority. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec. 1940): A negligible sales demand and consequent lack of activity have resulted in little or no change in prices for single houses, of which the area is entirely comprised. Today's range approximates that of 1939: $3500 to $5500. A few small new cottages have been sold in here for prices ranging in $2500 class, but these are exceptional and not at all consistent with the balance of the area. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): Same as for 1938-39; sinlges renting for $30 to $45 and not much activity very little seasonal movement in this district is too rural in character. Very few vacancies observed in a tour of the area. General Comments: Some new construction in here recently: 14 small 4 to 5 room bungalows just south of Amboy Road in the small detached section of C-23. These were built by a Brooklyn concern and trouble was experienced even before completion, with the sanitation. The land is low at that point and drainage is insufficient. The condition was so bad that the Sanitary Department refused to issue certificates of occupancy for these houses. They were sold at various prices with this defect, probably $2500 being the top price, and are now all occupied. In general the area is best north of Amboy Road, though even here poor houses are scattered among the better ones. The three \"stems\" extending northward in this area are all very sparsely developed, perhaps about 20 to 30%. Much of the area was cut through with streets and sidewalks years ago in the hope of future growth which never came. This is particularly true of the eastern most \"finger\", along Hugenot Avenue, where there are only two streets with houses: Rathbun and Rensselaer (north of Edgegrove). The street surface in here is very bad on all side streets: sidewalks are partially overgrown with small trees and brush. Three new bungalows with built in garages on Ramona Avenue, a brand new dual highway which opens up some good building sites in this area. HOLC has 15 houses in the area; institutions have an estimated 50 at the most. Sales have been rarae. (None for HOLC). Approval of the new dry dock site in Prince's Bay should make a tremendous difference here.

","5":"Principal highways: Amboy Rd., Hyland Ave., Main St. Many foreclosures in this section. Old native element still dominating. Most of the residents were employed in factories across the river in New Jersey with the partial shut down of many of these. Stagnation is apparent in Tottenville. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Prices on properties which were quoted at $7000 in 1938-39 have dropped about 10% or more. Approaching the bottom of the range for singles, the price drop becomes progressively less, 5% being the average loss in value for the smaller houses in the $2500 class. Two family structures are at an absolute minimum of demand and few indeed are sales of this type. Prices would be arbitrary and are not even suggested, as sellers will take almost anything they can get in forced sales of this kind. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): Rents were low here in 1939 and have not regained any of the drop which followed the industrial decline in Tottenville about 1930. The village is too far removed from the New York ferry and there are no local opportunities for employment. Transportation via the Outerbridge Crossing to nearby New Jersey is expensive, and those who are employed in Jersey factories prefer to live on that side of the river (Arthur Kill). Prices today would be no different than they were two years ago, i.e. $22 to $45 for singles; $25 to $45 for two family units. General Comments: Attractions are away from Tottenville rather than to it. Some houses are standing vacant because it is difficult to find tenants because of the distance to the New York ferry, and the cost of getting there (25 cents). This was a fairly thriving town when the shipyards were operating, but with their closing in 1930 came a decline. There is very little activity here today. HOLC holds some 36 houses unsold and institutions have an estimated 75 more. As stated, sales have been very few. HOLC sold only one during 1940. Here again, great activity would probably result from the approval of the proposed Prince's Bay drydock site, which is now under consideration.

","5":"Main highway: Henderson Ave. Some of the large old houses were converted to small private schools. Small houses have not suffered so much and due to the location they can still be rented at a fair figure. Sales Prices (Dec.1940): About 5% lower than 1938-39 levels due to lack of demand for the large old fashioned single houses in this area. Today these are difficult to dispose of, even at $7000 to $7500 which is less than half of what they were quoted in pre-depression times immediately prior to 1929. Sales trend is definetely downward, in line with demand, which fades with the demise of the present owners who are principally retired folk. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): In line with the good rental demand in nearly all sections of Staten Island, this area is no exception. Prices here are fairly firm at same levels as during 1938-39: $55-$65 for larger old houses; $45 to $55 for 6 to 8 room houses. Rental demand is helped by proximity to New York ferries and by the fact that this area is in a five cent fare zone. General Comments:This area is near the U.S. Gypsum Company's plant in New Brighton, which concern has profited indirectly from defense activities in the way of building construction on Staten Island and elsewhere in the New York area. However, no great increase in employment has resulted, and some of those who have been hired come from other boroughs as commuters. The same may be said of shipyard increases. Many of the new employees have been recruited from outside the borough and it is a commonly heard complaint that the Staten Island men \"can't even get inside the gates\". There are various explanations of this. One is that shipyard work has been at a low ebb here for such a long while that those who were laid off long ago have passed the age where they are regarded as desirables, and are being passed over in favor of younger men from outside. The McWilliams shipyard, within a mile of this area has just been acquired by the National Youth Administration which has announced its intention to use the yard as a training center for those between the ages of 18 and 23 in ship work. About 1400 are to be thus engaged, principally local residents. It is not expected that this will have much effect on the area except insofar as rentable rooms are concerned.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Arbitrarily set at $3000 to $4500 for singles since there have been no traceable sales in here recently. Two family structures have seen no activity either, and today's prices would probably be a little lower than in 1938-39, following the general trend on Staten Island. From $5000 to $8000 would include most of these. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): About the same as 1938-39, with singles in rentable condition renting from $35 to $40; units in the few available two flats priced the same. General Comments: Sales and rental prices quoted for this area may appear to be a little high considering the grading assigned here. However, the very unfavorable topography, poor appearance of surroundings and yards, wide variety of types and sizes and sparse development all have been considered in grading. This is a typical example of an area where Italians have gone in and built good and even expensive houses right next door to the most wretched hovels, and only a few yards from the swampy bed of a stream. The area has absolutely no charm, regarded as a whole, although there are a number of well constructed and expensive masonry and brick structures, typically the Mediterranean design. Small vegetable gardens are in evidence throughout the area; chickens and pigeons are a common sight, and the prevalence of wrapped-up fig trees indicates unmistakeably the high percentage of Italian dwellers. About the center line of the area, at the north end, is a pumping station, and along the north boundary (Victory Boulevard) are gas stations and auto repair shops. A small auto junk yard is situated about the center of this area. The land is lowest along the center line, north and south, and rises to the east and west. Best values are near the east and west boundaries. Two small new houses, brick bungalows were notes, both at the extreme boundaries of the area (south and west). There is plenty of room for building in here but little likelihood of any but Italians going into the area. Streets are very poor (except boundary streets) and sidewalks lacking. If anything, the trend is downward, and is certainly down as far as it can go to any but Italian buyers.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): This area has seen some decline since 1938, and today's prices for singles here would range pretty generally between $1500 and $5000, with few examples toward the latter figure. There are very few two family structures here; these are in no demand, despite the fact that this is an Italian neighborhood, and would be difficult to sell at $5000 to $7000. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): About $20 to $35 for singles, or units in two family structures when available. There is a fair rental demand at $25 a month, but the demand does not extend much beyond this figure at present, and prices have apparently levelled off in the absence of any activity on this side of the Island. General Comments: There is a seaside summer hospital for children in this area. No gas in most of the area. HOLC has 15 parcels; 2 have been sold in the past year. Institutions are reported to have a few properties here but have had difficulty in selling at any but lowest prices and most favorable terms. No new construction during the past year and none probable. Cedar Grove Beach, a summer community of cheap bungalows, is adjacent on the south, but is separated from this area by an enclosure. The \"Golf Club\" indicated on the map, adjacent on the north, is in fact no more than an open field, grass grown and untended. There are a number of boarded up cottages, these being for the most part summer dwellings. An Italian restaurant, a small Italian club and a few small taverns dot the area. At the north-east corner, on Hyland Avenue is a relic of a bygone time: the one remaining PeeWee Golf Course on Staten Island. This area was viewed during a rain. Water filled many of the gutters and overflowed in places on the roadways, making foot traffic difficult since there are few sidewalks. As in most Italian sections, there are a few outstandingly good homes, which however, do not raise the general quality. The trend here is downward.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Only a nominal difference between 1938-39 prices- and those of today. This area has seen very little activity, due to its isolated location, unfavorable topography and the racial picture. There is practically no demand here today for anything within the range of $2000 to $4000 which pretty well brackets the area. Improvements are practically all single family dwellings. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): As nearly as can be estimated prices have not fluctuated during the past two years; home ownership is comparatively high, but those which are rented bring from $20 to $35. Only one vacancy was noted during a tour of the area, that being a small stucco house in rather poor condition, boarded up, with the HOLC sign attached. General Comments: A small stream traverses this area, from east to west- not shown on the map. Along this watercourse are some marshy spots, extending in wet weather out into the roadways. The area is bounded on the north by a steep wooded slope at the summit of which are a few fairly good houses. Italian occupancy of a considerable number of dwellings is denoted by the presence of grape arbors, chicken runs, pigeon cotes and the inevitable \"bangaled-up\" fig trees. Roads are narrow and in rather poor condition in places, and there are no sidewalks. Sheds, out-houses and miscellaneous small and shabby buildings are scattered throughout the area. Housing is very mixed as to type, size, material and condition. No planning whatever, and some small houses cling precariously to the steep slopes, while others are almost inaccessbile in wet weather because of marshy pools along the roadways in the \"bottom\". Poor maintenance, untidy yards, and absolute lack of uniformity characterize this area and the trend is downward.

Best values are along the beach front, which is high above the water, permitting good construction in the extreme southwest part. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): Where monthly rentals are obtained for year round occupancy, these range from $20 to $35. Summer season cottages and bungalows rent from $100 to $250 for the period June to September inclusive. By far the majority of houses here were built for summer occupancy. The demand for such in this area is fair. For year round occupancy it appears to be a little better since nearly all the houses suitable for such are occupied. General Comments: There are many very small and cheap summer bungalows on very small lots in this area. These are boarded up during the winter months, giving the area a barren appearance. The southwesterly two or three streets have recently been resurfaced with gravel, but for the most part street surfaces are poor. There are two private boat yards in the area, and during the season clam diggers operate from here.

","5":"Three closely related small \"red\" areas, separated by undeveloped areas. Oldest section of Tottenville. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): No noticeable change during the past two years. Singles prices today at $1500 to $2500 with practically no activity; two family houses at $2000 to $4000, with no demand and no activity. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): About the same as 1939 at $15 to $25 for singles and units in two family structures (unheated). Demand is fair and vacancies are few in properties which are in good rentable condition. General Comments: This area was formerly dependent largely upon the Tottenville ship yards, where most of the dwellers here found employment. With the closing of operations in the yards, a decline set in, from which Tottenville and the neighboring community of Richmond Valley has never recovered. About the only local source of employment today is a small copper smelting works. Some of the residents of the area work in the factories along the New Jersey shore, across Arthur Kill River. This, however, involved expensive transportation via automobile over the Outerbridge Crossing, or passage on the ferry to Perth Amboy. Those who found employment in Jersey, and were able, generally moved there. There are two small and somewhat isolated portions of this area, lying north of the Rapid Transit Railroad. These were developments of a sort, built some years ago during more prosperous times in the community. They are principally occupied by a foreign population and present a stagnant appearance, with no new construction. The western portion is somewhat better, more uniform and more accessible. Steep slopes are a detriment in the eastern part. HOLC has one house here, undergoing reconditioning, situated next to a small German tavern on a brushy hillside overlooking the railroad tracks. Difficult to predict any future improvement here and the trend appears downward if anything. ","6":"1. Atlantic 2.

Principal highways: Bay St., Va Duzon St. Large portion of area is unrestricted with a high ratio of assessed valuation to market value in those parts. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Weaker on all classes of housing than in 1938-39. Singles are priced generally from $2000 to $6500, with little demand toward the upper end of the bracket. Most sales reported are around $4000. Two family structures are in little demand and due to institutional price cutting in the effort to reduce inventories, have come down to something like $3500 to $7500, which may be termed an arbitrary bracket inasmuch as there have been no sales reported recently. A few old three and four family dwellings, \"old law tenements\" are scattered throughout this area. These have been in no demand, and prices are arbitrarily mentioned as $3000 to $5500, a little lower than in 1938-39. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): No appreciable change in rents. Singles range from $20 to $45- most of them nearer the former figure: two family units at $20 to $50, the latter figure being for those where heat is supploed; flats in the old law tenements, three and four family, fall within $15 to $25, some with heat, most of them unheated. General Comments: This section was expected to improve with the coming of the Free Port immediately adjacent on the east. However, these expectations were not realized, possibly due to stringency of manufacturing laws and to other restrictions imposed. There has been very little development here accordingly, and residential districts adjoining have derived no benefits. Until recently the Zone was used for loading planes and trucks for shipment to France, but with the collapse of the French Republic this activity has ceased and the piers are for the most part idle. Best residential values and prosepcts are along the thoroughfare separating the area from the Fox Hills Golf Club property on the south (Vanderbilt Avenue). HOLC has 12 parcels in the area at present and has sold 5 since last May. No new constuction was noted during a tour of the area, and the trend is at best static and possibly downward slightly.

Prices, arbitrarily, are $1500 to $3000 for the miscellany of old frame cottages, houses and shacks which dot the area.

The area continues to be occupied, but there is certainly nothing that could be called a demand here, and the inhabitants are those who have had no opportunity to move elsewhere, or were unable to dispose of their porperty and had no recourse but to remain and live in it. (/n) General Comments: The communtiy lies in a hollow, with hills rising gently to southward.  At the south boundary is a small cemetery.  Northward, across Arthur Kill Road are small old docks and a boat buildign yard, the scene of no activity today.  Several churches, one of them Hungarian (Magyar) are located along the main thoroughfare, Arthur Kill Road.  These are generally shabby in appearance and bear a deserted look.  A small burying ground with head stones dating back to 1805, grown up with thorns and brush, testifies to the age of the village, and to its decadence.  There are a few small boarded up shops along the main street.  Some fairly good old fashioned houses, having an owner-occupied look are out of keeping with the rest of the town.  Small taverns are fairly numerous, and the local fire department headquarters, a fairly respectable looking structure, has a large \"For Sale\" sign across its front.

(/n) Sales Price (Dec 1940): There has been some decline in the higher priced properties in here, possibly due to the cuts of similar types of Building and Loan Associations in surrounding areas.  Single houses today are quoted generally from $3000 to $5500, with little demand.  Two family structures range between $4500 to $6500, and it would be a rare occurance if one were to be sold for a higher figure.

Some recent roadways improvement, consisting of new gravel surface, has brightened up some of the interior streets, although it has brought about no new building construction as yet.  That portion of the area lying west of the railroad and along the right of way, is of worst appearance, and it would be difficult to find a more forbidding aspect any place on Staten Island.  A low, almost vacant plot is traversed by roadways which are all but impassable in good weather, and would be a morass in the rainy season.  A few very poor houses are scattered about in this part, most of them bearing indications of Italian occupancy, i.e. pigeons, chickens, small outsheds and general trashy surroundings.  A number of small stores are located in the vicinity of the railroad station at Fingerboard Road.  Transportation faciltiies are good.

","5":"Principal highways: Richmond Terrace, Victory Blvd. Business all along Jersey St. & all along northerly side Victory Blvd. Part of area unrestricted, part zoned for business- about 1/3 residentially zoned. Negroes principally on Jersey St., Italians on Brighton Ave. and Park Ave. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): About 5% weaker on all types than in 1938-39, probably due in part to price cutting by institutions in attempt to clear inventories. Singles range from $1200 to $6000 with very few likely to command the latter figure. Two family structures currently quoted from $3500 to $5750, with little demand at any except sacrifice prices. The \"old law tenements\"- 3 to 5 family flats, of which there are a number scattered throughout the area, are arbitrarily mentioned as being worth from $2500 to $4000. However, no sales have been located to support these figures. Rental Prices (Dec. 1940): Proximity to New York ferries and to business center and Administration Offices of the Borough have kept rents fairly steady here, though many of the houses and apartments offered in pretty poor condition, inside and out. Singles rent from $15 to $50; units in two flats at $20 to $50; and the \"cold water flats\" in 3,4 and 5 family structures bring from $15 to $25. There is a wide variation in desirability and condition of quarters in this area, and consequently an appreciable spread in brackets given above. General Comments: The United States Housing Authority is at present conducting a survey in this area with a view of carrying out slum clearance projects. It is known that investigations have been carried out and searches made on Jersey, Westervelt and Cleveland Streets within the area. Although details were not available, it is understood that the Staten Island Savings Bank not long ago sold two parcels here at about $1000 cash each, same being a 3 flat with store and a 4 family with 3 stores. High assessments, lack of restrictions, permitting business encroachment, and Italian infiltration depress residential desirability in this area. Probably the trend is downward in the absence of any clearance project. Since writing the above it has been learned that the Housing project has been finally approved to begin next spring. Construction will cost $1,559,000, and accomodations are to be provided for 264 low income families at an average rental of $19 monthly. The exact location of the site has not been announced but it is to be in New Brighton according to reports.

General Comments: North end subject to Baltimore and Ohio Railroad yard influence; also to offensive odors from manufacture of gas. A large storage tank is situated near the intersection of the Rapid Transit Company with Edgewater Street. This presents not only an eyesore, but a possibly source of fire or explosion. The Marine Hospital at the north boundary of the area is a fine, modern and well kept institution and probably a favorable influence in some respects. Across from this and along Vanderbilt Avenue are a lot of old but fairly well maintained houses owned by the Vanderbilt Estate- all for sale. Townsend Avenue was a fine street before the coming of the Baltimore and Ohio yards and the Gas Company's factory and tank. It is now a typical slum. A tour of the area disclosed no new construction and it would be very difficult to get a loan in this section except on the most stringent terms.

New York City, N.Y. ","5":"Main highways: Hylan Blvd., McClean Ave. Some structures erected as 2-family dwellings have been legally converted to 3 and 4 family use- some are used illegally for such occupancy. Nearly all Italian in this area. Good structures and most dilapidated often side by side. Many foreclosures and local financial institutions are willing to take big losses on sales of such property. Only sacrifice sales made in recent years. Zoning business except small section at west end which is completely built up. \"South Beach\" has a bad name and has been on the decline for 30 years, and is only liked by Italians. N.Y. Tunnel Authority may at some future time put a tube across the Narrows. This would benefit those areas. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): About 5% lower than 1938-39 levels on singles; a little greater loss on two-flats. Today's prices on one family houses in this area would for the most part fall within the $2750-$5750 bracket, a majority being nearer the first figure. Two family dwellings are in poor demand despite the fact that this is an Italian neighborhood. About $4000 to $7000 is arbitrarily stated to be the range, though there have been few sales to support it. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): Singles rent from $20 to $40 with little or no change from 1938-39. Units in two-flats at $20 to $45, the latter figure being about right for heated units. Demand is fair and there are not many vacancies where the property is in rentable condition. Prices a little lower here for comparable houses. General Comments: This is an area which would benefit greatly by the construction of a tunnel across the Narrows as has often been mentioned during years past. The Hylan administration was particularly favorable to such a project but with the defeat of that Mayor hope seems to have waned and instead of putting in a tunnel to develop Staten Island, it is now felt that the Island should first develop to a point where a tunnel becomes necessary, and more to the point, self liquidating to a degree. Conditions are bad in this area today, and they have been bad for a long time, at least by comparison with most other sections of the Island. The racial factor, and the prevelance of cheap poor summer cottages along the south fringe; taverns, and the element attracted thereto during the warm months have all hurt the neighborhood. No new construction was noted during a tour of the area. HOLC has 21 parcels here now; has sold 6 during the current year.

Zoning mixed; partly unrestricted, partly business. Small section residential. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): About 5% lower than 1938-39 levels which were for singles: $2000 to $6000; and for two family structures: $2000 to $8000. Demand is notably lacking and sales have been few in recent months although some improvement may be anticipated due to the increase in activity in the ship yards along this shore. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): Remain practically unchanged from 1938-39 levels. Singles today rent from $20 to $45; units in multiple dwellings from $20 to $35. Some improvement may be expected due to increased activity as mentioned above. General Comments: The Negro population is understood to be increasing in this area, and to be moving also up into C-6 from here. The McWilliams ship yard, at the northeast corner of the area has recently been acquired by the National Youth Adminstration for training purposes. It is proposed to accomodate some 700 apprentices between the ages of 18 and 22 to learn shipbuilding and allied trades. Most of these are to come from Staten Island, and it is quite probable that some of the older larger houses in the neighborhood may be converted to furnish lodging for the trainees. To date many of the new jobs in the ship yards along this shore appear to have been filled from outside Staten Island, and most of these new men are still comuting if license plates on parked cars may be taken as an indication. Thus the demand for housing has not kept pace with the increase in employment locally.

","5":"One large industry, Proctor & Gamble, at Howland Hook employing 2000. This firm has been active. The ship yards bordering on the north now employ about 350 whereas they once employed 3500. Some small yards have been abandoned. Main highways: Richmond Terrace, Richmond Ave., Forest Ave., Morningstar Road. Supplemental Information: Sales Price (Dec.1940): As nearly as can be determined, about 5% lower than in 1938-39, with singles ranging from $2250 to $5750 and two family structures more or less arbitrarily priced from $4750 to $7000. Institutions have made some consistent cuts in here. Moreover, the increase in employment in local and adjacent ship yards has not yet produced the sales impetus hoped for since many of the new men commute from New Jersey and Brooklyn. It is expected that further increase will eventually result in a stimulated demand as employees are able to accumulate a reserve sufficient to enable them to buy locally. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): About the same as 1938-39 with singles bringing from $25 to $35; units in two family dwellings renting from $25 to $35, generally without heat. A tour of the area disclosed very few vacancies and the demand appears to be good with prospects of some improvement with further increases of employment in defense industries along this shore. General Comments: There has been an increase of over 2000 jobs in the ship yards just north of this area during the past year. Some complaint has been heard that preference has been given to those from outside the borough. Real estate certainly has not felt the stimulus which might be expected from so considerable an upturn in industry. There has not been much demand for housing in this area, at least no such demand as was hoped for by local realtors and others following the increases above noted. HOLC has at present 28 parcels here; 14 were sold during the past year, most of them at prices somewhat higher than have been obtained by competitors operating here. Institutions have consistently cut prices in this area but their holdings are pretty well reduced now. At present the trend here appears static.

Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): Down about 10% below 1938-39 levels, with today's range on singles from $4000 to $5000. Some prospective demand here from colored population which are moving toward the area. Rental Prices (Dec.1940): No change from 1938-39 range, which was $30 to $35 for singles. A tour of the area disclosed no vacancies and it is anticipated that an improved demand may result from completion and occupancy of the Asylum for Mental Defectives now under construction just west of the area. About 5000 patients are expected here, and the policy of the city administration has been to employ colored help, as has been done at the Tuberculosis Hospital just south of the area. This area may very conceivably develop into a colored concentration. General Comments: Some negroes have gone into the ungraded area just east of D-8. The Northfield Savings and Loan Association recently sold a two family stucco residence which was used for a colored rooming house, at 26 Graves Street, for $3500; $100 down payment; lease and option. If this area should be taken over by the colored employees of Seaview Hospital and the Asylum for Mental Defectives, some decreases in values will be inevitable. It appears at present that the area is headed in just that direction.

","5":"Principal highway: Victory Blvd., Richmond Ave. Assessed value of $30 a front foot along Richmond Ave. in this area whereas $15 would be a high value today. Same condition along Victory Blvd. in this area. Supplemental Information: Sales Prices (Dec.1940): About 5% to 10% lower than in 1938-39. Singles are priced, more or less arbitrarily since no sales were located in this area, at $2000 to $4000. No demand except at positive giveaway prices. Two family structures range from $2500 to $4500, with no demand, and two such structures were noted in a tour of the area, both boarded up. (One was HOLC owned). Rental Prices (Dec.1940): About the same as 1939- $15 to $30 for singles or units in two family dwellings, though the area is not attractive to renters. Practically no demand, and not much movement to or from the area. Appears quite stagnant. General Comments: This is one of the most unattractive spots on Staten Island. Development is principally along Richmond Avenue where small poor houses and shacks are thinly strung out, interspersed with occasional one room shops and taverns. East and west of this thoroughfare the land falls off into swampy meadows. Many of the homes have tiny garden plots; trash and litter is in evidence throughout the area; paving is very poor on all but the main highway, and grape vines and bundled-up fig trees testify to the nationality of the dwellers here. Small junk yards, greenhouses, a brick yard, and a marble works penalize the area to almost any but Italian residents. At the southern extremity are two fair sized taverns at the intersection of Richmond Avenue with Victory Boulevard. Here also are gas stations and garage. There are a very few large and quite old houses, probably the first built in this neighborhood and still standing. These are along Richmond Avenue and occupy large plots but appear to be in poor condition and are not in demand at any price because of the comparatively high assessments along here. The detached portion of the area to the south and along Victory Boulevard is so sparsely settled as to be of no importance whatever. (HOLC has one large old \"wreck\" in there- the only one on the \"street\"- boarded up.) South of Victory Boulevard a little way, and visible from that thoroughfare, are large buildings of the new Asylum for mentally defective children; not yet in operation but nearing completion. This adjoins Willowbrook Park and is just east of it. Here also is a sewage disposal plant. There is some slight development a little way south of the intersection of Richmond Avenue and Victory Boulevard, not graded on the map. This portion is sparse, and not new, but somewhat better than other parts of this area and perhaps should be included therein. There are some sizable truck farms and smaller plots south of here, along Richmond Avenue, principally operated by Italians. It is hardly worth saying that there is no new construction in the area.
