He discovered that the area lacker water and teh trend would not be in that direction, so after intering his circus hre for serveral years, traded off the land. It is a hilly section, unattractive and occupied by a variety of cheap frame houses, some shacks and some fairly good wage earners homes. It is a heavy special assessment section which is detrimental to the porperty therein.

That portion north of13th is occupied by a poor class of jews and is a terrace district.
