This clean neighborhood was platted in 1925 and is now 25% built up with uniform single residences that reflect strong pride of ownership. All streets are concrete with complete installation of utilities. Fifteen new homes were constructed here during the past 12 months. Good restrictions will hold this area's attractiveness to professional and business men, but future growth will be fairly slow due to the outlying location and weak transportation servive (hourly bus).

Deed and zoning restrictions are rigid (price bracket $7500-$12,500) but lack of school facilities and distance to churches, shopping center and transportation (S. Moreland Blvd. Rapid Transit to the north) have resulted in considerable sales resistance, although half hour bus service may be obtained via Lee Rd. (western boundary). The major part of development to date has occured close to Lee. Rd. and future of area appears favorable but informed realtor's opinion is that top price bracket will decrease approximately 20% with the advent of additional construction until this will become an $8000-$10,000 neighborhood. Several families, in order to avail themselves of school facilities in Shaker Hts., now pay an additional tax for this purpose.

(Van Sweringen subsidary). Rigid deed restrictions were then affected setting the size of foundations to lot frontage as follows: 40' lot - 28' foundation; 45' lot - 33' foundation; 50' lot - 35' foundation (depth of foundation not to exceed width.) Corner lots having 7000 sq. ft. or more of space are zoned for duplex construction but for the most part are undeveloped. The exception of Northwood and Silsby Aves. (N.W. part) from these restrictions caused the formation of a Residents' Committee about 2 years ago which now must pass on all construction plans prior to approval by the Van Sweringen Co. thus placing a second rigid test on new construction. The present active pace of construction dates back to only 1935 but has continued to gain momentum since that time. John Carroll University is located in area, and also a golf course. Proximity of this area to Hathaway-Brown (private school for girls) is a strong selling point. Area has express bus service (22 min. to downtown) but lacks store facilities which are being planned for at the intersection of Warrensville and Fairmount Blvd. (center fo south boundary). Most expensive homes ($12,500-$16,500) are located principally east of Warrensville Rd. around the University grounds and also in S.W. part on Edgerton and Claridge. Future for this excellent neighborhood appears very favorable for the next 10-15 years. Five percent vacancy consists only of new constructions not yet occupied by owners or vacant-for-sale.

The Heaton-Pennington Subdivision was laid out about 15 years ago, development began 12 years ago, and has proceeded steadily since that time. Sales were made principally to Jewish purchasers. Lots average 45-60 ft. frontage and originally sold for $50-$55 per front foot - now bring $25-$30 per foot. This part of area is now built up approximately 30% with harmonious, well restricted home development. New homes, principally, average $12,500 in price. The Severance Estate (lying to the north of the Heaton-Pennington Subdivision) at present has but two parts developed for lot sales (north side of Severn and west side of Crest Rds.). Balance of this area has been platted but not opened for development due to the fact that utility and pavement costs, plus ground value, as a highly restricted residential section, will not bring an equitable price in the present market. Sixty foot lots held at $2450 on Severn Rd. and $1850 on Crest Rd. are not finding ready takers. The Oak Ridge section (lying north of Mayfield Rd.) is an older and more expensive development than balance of this area to the south. Original development of expensive homes ranging in value up to $80,000 have suffered severely on the sales market due to the cheaper home developments surrounding this area. Informed realtor's opinion is that no property in this section will bring more than $30,000 as evidenced by recent sales. Four of the 19 new homes (last 12 mos.) built in area were located in this Oak Ridge Section. Lots average 60' x 150' frontage. New construction, in this 30% built up section, averages about $12,500 indicating that future development and values will stabilize at about this figure. No Jewish occupancy exists in the Oak Ridge section and, from best sources, it appears that future development of the Severance Estate will closely parallel its desirability with the nearby Rockefeller-Forest Hill development and the Oak Ridge section of this area.","9":"Cleveland Hts.

These apparently were over-improvements and later were taken over by Rockefeller and sold for approximately $20,000 to $22,000. Later development in this area, principally during 1938 and first half of 1939 consisted of 15 stone and frame homes ranging in price from $12,500 to $18,500. At present 4 remain to be sold (still under construction). Construction of homes in this area is subject to approval of plans by Rockefeller architects. This area has all desirable influences; lots average 60 ft. x 160 ft. - present lot sale prices approximate $2,200 (including all improvements and subterranean utilities) from street to house paid for. Proximity to commercial district and transportation along Mayfield Rd., including schools and churches is a favorable factor. With the apparent interest directed towards development of this section, desirability should be further enhanced by individual owner construction and outside development interests with general improvement in economic conditions.

Homes were first built along Glynn and Brewster costing from $22,500 to $45,000. Eighty-one of these houses were built during period from 1930-1931. Sale of same was halted by the depression (only three sold and the balance were put on a rental basis with such exclusive services as landscaping maintenance, police protection, private car transportation to stores and public transportation). Reappraisal of these properties, in 1936, placed them on the market within the bracket of $13,200 to $22,000 and sales were very satisfactory; mostly to tenants. Immediately following completion of this program, lots were placed on the market for sale for the first time but development was opened only one block at a time. Other construction to date, besides that of the Rockefeller interest, amounts to only three houses. At present the whole area is approximately 25% built-up (principally concentrated in the northern part along Glynn and Brewster and the north sides of Wyatt, Fenemore and Henley). This area has all desirable advantages and, with existing minimum building restrictions of $12,500, will continue to maintain its exclusive desirability. However, rapid construction in this area within the next 3 to 5 years is not anticipated due to the fact that Rockefeller interests are favoring the quicker development of the southern part of the allotment lying in Cleveland Heights due to transportation, stores and schools along Mayfield Rd. However, favored schools and their accessibility to this East Cleveland section of Forest Hills will hold all residents. According to the best informed opinion, present salable value of vacant lots in this area are bringing little, if any, more than the actual cost of installed utilities and improvements which are all subterranean, paid for, including those from street to house.","9":"East Cleveland (Forest Hills) 1st A-29","71":"8","72":"26.4","1a":"Slowly  ","1b":"Executive - Professional ($10,000 up income)","1c":"0 All American - 4 Jewish families","1d":"0","1e":"None","2a":"Singles - 6-9 rooms ","2b":"Brick & stone ","2c":"8 years ","2d":"Excellent ","2e":"99% ","2f":"95% ","2g":"13,500-20,000 ","2h":"14,000-20,000 3  ","2i":"1939 14,000-20,000 0  ","2j":"Good ","2k":"Firm ","2l":"150-200 ","2m":"150-200 0  ","2n":"1939 150-200 0  ","2o":"Excellent ","2p":"Stable ","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"","5a":"","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.845981,41.477265],[-81.854171,41.473637],[-81.857613,41.472112],[-81.85889,41.472068],[-81.859603,41.474227],[-81.860554,41.477677],[-81.867209,41.477566],[-81.867269,41.481483],[-81.864357,41.481661],[-81.862426,41.481439],[-81.858712,41.480638],[-81.857969,41.480838],[-81.856989,41.481127],[-81.848343,41.48293],[-81.846412,41.483286],[-81.846769,41.482774],[-81.846887,41.481951],[-81.846798,41.481105],[-81.846442,41.48037],[-81.84665,41.479413],[-81.846947,41.478011],[-81.846264,41.477477],[-81.845981,41.477265]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"A3","holc_grade":"A","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"100 ","3":"80-100 $9000-15,000 Mostly speculative, Rapidly","5":"","6":"Ample","8":"This area, known as Beach Cliff Subdivision, was laid out in 1919; a well planned and a very desirable residential section.

However, restrictions do not permit summer cottage construction now and teh few exlating structures are steadily being removed. Development has been slow due to cutlying location and weak transportation (hourly bus).

Future growth of area will be along conservative lines but attractiveness as a residential section will increase as the closer-in areas become mor fully developed. The presence of the New York Central RR running parallel with the southern boundary of area as a sales resistant factor is largely discounted by local realtors, since the roadbed is hedged in by trees.

Homes on Edgewater, Cliff, and Harborview range from $15,000-$25,000 and rent from $100-$125. Properties along Lake Ave. range from $12,000-$18,000 with a rental spread of $75-$90. The south side of Lake Ave., from West Blvd. extending all the way to W. 115th St., is built up with apartments. The rest of the area, however, is restricted to residences and the restrictions have some 20 more years to run. There are approximately 12-15 two-family homes in this area, located on Lake Ave. The area is free from exterior detrimental influences and remains very desirable due to its proximity to Cleveland's Public Square. Although sales are moving slow because of the age and the large type of homes, the area's occupancy continues to be very strong and, in all probability, it will remain so for many years to come. Professional men, especially doctors and attorneys, find this neighborhood desirable because of its nearness to the center of Cleveland. It has excellent transportation and the Edgewater Park bathing beach lies immediately east of this area. Its only handicap is the school situation; there are no junior or senior high schools and the nearest grade school (W. 105th and Baltic), which is located south of the area, stops at the 5th grade and children are compelled to go to the nearest full grade school which is about 1 to 1 1/2 miles away. However, informed realtor's opinion is that school handicap affects only a small portion of occupants (medium income bracket) for the majority of families send their children to private schools.","9":"Cleveland (W. side) 2nd B-16 ","10":"","71":"8","72":"30.2","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Professional - Business men - White-collared","1c":"0 ","1d":"0","1e":"None","2a":"Single, 8 rooms ","2b":"Brick ","2c":"18-20 years ","2d":"Good ","2e":"99% ","2f":"90% ","2g":"12,000-25,000 ","2h":"12,000-25,000 0  ","2i":"Sept. 1939 12,000-25,000 0  ","2j":"Slow ","2k":"Firm to weak ","2l":"75-125 ","2m":"75-125 0  ","2n":"Sept. 1939 75-125 0  ","2o":"Good ","2p":"Firm ","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"","5a":"","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.769054,41.456343],[-81.768837,41.460476],[-81.768804,41.461099],[-81.765631,41.461152],[-81.765595,41.461446],[-81.765845,41.46206],[-81.762422,41.463325],[-81.758477,41.464821],[-81.753866,41.464999],[-81.754009,41.463574],[-81.754294,41.462363],[-81.754864,41.461615],[-81.757479,41.45987],[-81.757716,41.459228],[-81.757574,41.458195],[-81.759903,41.458088],[-81.760188,41.456343],[-81.769054,41.456343]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B17","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"70 30","3":"3 Singles, $7000-10,000 Owner-contracted","5":"","6":"Ample","8":"This area was alloted in about 1908-1910; one of the older residential sections of Cleveland and built up 95%.

The easterly section of area was platted in the warly 1920's and the westerly portion saw development  in the late 1920's. The area has all utilities installed and all streets paved, with the exception of W. 56th and W. 57th (south of Memphis); a small group of retail stores is concentrated at W. 48th and Memphis Ave. with a thin scattering on the \"numbered streets\" south of Memphis; convenient to schools and churches; transportation is by bus service on Memphis and W. 73rd - but transfer to street car is necessary to reach downtown. The single and two-family homes are intermingled, however the eastern half shows a predominance of two-family homes; new construction is concentrated along W. 56th and W. 57th on which streets some 15 new homes ($5200-6350) were erected within the past 12 months. Practically all of the unimproved lots are individually owned. The area will, in all likelihood, retain its present standard of desirability for several years due to proximity to Brookside (Zoological) Park and also because of its abuttment to first grade area (A-14). Likewise, construction of new bridge over Brookside Park has made this area more accessible and there has been a noticebale increase in demand since its construction. Some years ago the Representative Realty Co. had begun construction of many homes in this area and went broke leaving several \"skeletons\" standing in addition to about 50 completed new homes; the company's interests were purchased by the Sammon Investment Co. who, through a sound selling campaign, was successful in disposing of all but 6 of the properties. For instance, out of some 40 new homes located in W. 48th, the Sammon Co. sold 34 - each selling for a little over $7000 with a $500 down payment, balance by first bank loan and junior mortgage. It is noticeable that not one of the homes sold by Sammon Co. was foreclosed or taken back during the entire depression period. Institutional holdings in this area are below average at present.","9":"Cleveland (W. side) (formerly Brooklyn) 2nd B-20 9/28/39","10":"","71":"8","72":"30.2","1a":"Fairly rapid  ","1b":"Clerical - Business men - Better type of factory workers","1c":"2 ","1d":"0","1e":"20% of occupants are of second generation - mostly German","2a":"Singles - old 5-7 rooms, new 5 rooms 2-family, 5 rooms per units","2b":"Frame Frame","2c":"15 years 15 years","2d":"Good Good","2e":"99% 99%","2f":"85% 75%","2g":"5200-7000 6000-8500","2h":"5200-7000 0 6000-8500 0","2i":"Aug. 1939 5200-7000 0 6000-8500 0","2j":"Good Good","2k":"Slightly upward Slightly upward","2l":"35-45 27.50-42.50","2m":"35-450 0 27.50-42.50 0","2n":"Aug. 1939 37.50-50 9 30-45 7","2o":"Good Good","2p":"Upward Upward","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"","5a":"","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.698402,41.437736],[-81.697451,41.437486],[-81.688039,41.437664],[-81.687992,41.435241],[-81.687279,41.434849],[-81.687279,41.425369],[-81.687992,41.424834],[-81.687944,41.424121],[-81.696215,41.423586],[-81.696738,41.424228],[-81.700874,41.424299],[-81.701254,41.426295],[-81.707481,41.426509],[-81.707196,41.42797],[-81.697689,41.427792],[-81.697546,41.431107],[-81.702062,41.431107],[-81.702585,41.429931],[-81.706768,41.430002],[-81.70558,41.432636],[-81.698735,41.432782],[-81.698782,41.435134],[-81.700589,41.436453],[-81.698402,41.437736]],[[-81.695312,41.432853],[-81.695217,41.425796],[-81.689845,41.425333],[-81.689941,41.425975],[-81.689465,41.426687],[-81.68956,41.432711],[-81.695312,41.432853]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B21","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"70 30","3":"30 $5800-7000 50% speculative bldg., Good","5":"","6":"Ample","8":"This fairly level area is situated in the extreme southeast corner of West Cleveland along Broadview Rd. and Schaaf Rd.

There is evidence that new construction is on the increase in the Oak park Section (lying immediately south of Brooklyn Heights Cemetery). The southeasterly section corner (east of W. 15th at Schaaf Rd.) is widely known as the \"Schaaf Rd. Greenhouse District\" and is owned by wealthy gardeners. Presence of cemetery on the west and (15) greenhouses on the southeast, although not considered by brokers as sales resisting forces, no doubt have a tendency to throttle activity here.

This section, fairly flat with very little wooded area, was formerly open farm land until platted about 1924-25 into lots averaging 40 ft. x 120 ft. and is now about 45-50% built up. Development was very rapid during 1926-27 but became dormant in 1929 and remained so virtually until spring of this year. However, new construction sales this year have been so favorable that several builders are seriously planning steady construction (one a week) in the southern portion west of Turney Rd. The most expensive homes are located along and near Edge Park Blvd. abutting Garfield Park and range in price from $6500 to $17,000. There are also about five homes on the north side of Garfield Blvd. between E. 94th & Turney Rd. and about ten homes on the Blvd. east of Turney Rd. averaging from $7500 to $15,000. Occupants of this area are principally desirable second and third generation of foreign descent who were raised in the older foreign sections such as the third and fourth grade areas around E. 65th & Fleet and E. 55th & Broadway. These inhabitants take great prode in their home ownership and are constantly improving the appearance of their homes. The retail area for this whole neighborhood is along Turney Rd., particularly between Parkview and Richland Avenues. All utilities are in and all streets are paved except a part of Grace Avenue. This area has no detrimental influences and should continue to grow into a more desirable community. Development primarily will be in the part west of Turney Rd. since it is only 25% built up while the section east of Turney Rd. and to the north is built up about 75%. Agent's personal inspection of new construction revealed that properties are very well built. For example: five room, one floor plan homes, with copper plumbing, modern bath and kitchen fixtures, gas heat, 40 ft. x 120 ft. lots, are reasonably priced at $5600 to $5900 and are mostly being sold prior to completion. Homes constructed in price range of about $6500 are mostly owner-contracted.

Although fairly level in the central part, the northwesterly corner is very scenic and the southern section (mostly undeveloped) is rolling and heavily wooded. This section was platted into 40 ft. x 130 ft. lots, with the exception of East Blvd. (west boundary), about 1921-23. All utilities are in and transportation on E. 131st St. is excellent and has attributed much to the growth of the area. Only a few streets in southern part of area along eastern border remain to be paved (sidewalks and curbs already in). The most expensive homes (approximately 25-30) are located along East Blvd. on 60-70 ft. front lots and range in price from $9000 to $14,000. Practically all of the new construction, during the past year, was on or near East Blvd. Calvary Cemetery, with its beautiful park-liek appearance abutting the west boundary, appears to have no detrimental effect on these East Blvd. property values. The retail district of this area lies along E. 131st St. Properties abutting this retail area, however, are uniform in desirability with balance of section. Owing to a peculiarity of school district allotment, this section, alothough within the limits of Garfield Heights, sends its children to Cleveland schools and thus pay a school tax of approximately $30 to $40 per property less than the effective Garfield Heights rate. This has enhanced the desirability of the area, particularly for rental tenancy as revealed by the fact that not one rental unit is available at present. Area is free from all normal detrimental influences, except for one odd situation. Colored residents from the distant fourth grade neighborhood to the southeast have acquired the habit of walking through the fields up to and along Christine Ave. in order to avail themselves of the high speed transportation on E. 131st St. This condition has created some sales resistance to properties on that street. This area is now approximately 75% built up and will retain its desirability. Speculative builders do not appear to be interested in this area since all but two of the nine homes built during the past year have been by owner-contract. ","9":"Garfield Hts.

The other projection in that westerly part indicates slight development on side streets (two-thirds paved) just off Warrensville Rd. The northwestern corner contains two streets, Genessee and Sherbrooke, developed with modern 2-family homes ($10,000 class). Balance of area developed with singles; Harold ($6500); Buxton ($5500-6500 bungalows); Bexley Park ($9000 brick singles).

The part of area east of Renford Rds. to Green Rd. and south of Bayard contains the area's most expensive homes built about 12 yrs. ago ranging up to $30,000 but now bring $12,000-$15,000. Sale resistance due to lack of transportation and distance to stores, churches and schools (by bus) and principally due to the fact that part of this area consists of Torrenized Land (Acacia Dr., Langerdale and parts of Templehurst and Laurel Hill) involving several court suits for payment of assessments and taxes. The southeastern corner of area between Green and Lyndway south of Notre Dame (school for girls) contains only 6 houses ($8500 class) has lain dormant since the depression (deed restrictions unwarrantedly high). The portion of area north of Bayard between Renford and Green is mostly undeveloped, although streets are paved and utilities are in (15% built up with $6500-7500 bungalows and singles). The northeast corner of area (Maywood, Oakmont and Sheridan Sts.) had had very active building activity within the past 18 mos. (20 new homes in past 12 mos.) and sales have been very good here. This area's future will vary according to each small part as discussed above but informed realtor's opinion is that the northeastern portion between Green Rd. and east boundary south to Division will continue to be actively developed because of the attraction of its uniformity and proximity to schools, stores, churches and transportation on Mayfield Rd.

There is no market for these properties due to existing restrictions which prevent resubdivision for new home development. Owners of the largest parcels such as the Mathers, Cushings, Jordans and the Eddys still remain in this section. The possibility of lifting the restrictions to permit resubdivision is remote at the present time, therefore prices will continue downward for these large properties. The small southwesterly part of area (those streets south of Lake Shore Blvd.) is about 85% built up (40' front lots) with standard single homes intermingled with a few two families.

Bearing out this opinion is the fact that the small amount of desirable valley frontage in these abutting first grade areas will be fully developed first and the present structures in this second grade area, although only 10% built up, indicate that a similar or better type of homes will be built here.","9":"Rocky River 2nd B-5 9/12/39","10":"","71":"8","72":"23.6","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Business men","1c":"0 ","1d":"0","1e":"None","2a":"Singles, 6-7 rooms ","2b":"Frame ","2c":"8-10 years ","2d":"Good ","2e":"100% ","2f":"100% ","2g":"6000-8000 ","2h":"6000-8000 0  ","2i":"Aug. 1939 6000-8000 0  ","2j":"Fair ","2k":"Firm ","2l":"NO RENTALS ","2m":"   ","2n":"Aug. 1939    ","2o":" ","2p":" ","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"","5a":"","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.514211,41.569289],[-81.514033,41.567822],[-81.514104,41.566915],[-81.51553,41.566835],[-81.51717,41.566782],[-81.518097,41.566515],[-81.517812,41.565955],[-81.517491,41.565448],[-81.517455,41.564755],[-81.518525,41.564248],[-81.520129,41.563954],[-81.521876,41.563821],[-81.523124,41.563741],[-81.524657,41.563527],[-81.526083,41.563341],[-81.52701,41.563181],[-81.527509,41.563341],[-81.528222,41.563634],[-81.528971,41.563634],[-81.529078,41.563101],[-81.529185,41.563314],[-81.529399,41.563848],[-81.530183,41.563981],[-81.531288,41.563821],[-81.531217,41.564114],[-81.531395,41.565421],[-81.532144,41.567075],[-81.531253,41.568409],[-81.530611,41.569129],[-81.529506,41.568916],[-81.527474,41.568622],[-81.526903,41.568729],[-81.526796,41.569903],[-81.524621,41.569956],[-81.522696,41.570089],[-81.521983,41.569903],[-81.521128,41.569929],[-81.520771,41.570143],[-81.520807,41.568302],[-81.520486,41.567955],[-81.519701,41.567929],[-81.518275,41.568222],[-81.516386,41.568516],[-81.514496,41.568996],[-81.514211,41.569289]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B50","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"100 ","3":"12 6500-7000 Owner contracted","5":"1","6":"Ample","8":"This Chardon Hills section is the development of four or more allotments duringthe \"boom\" period of 1925-28.

In fact, there has been some sale of vacant lots by the Sheriff for unpaid taxes. Although restrictions throughout area have not been uniform, the original high price of lots apparently protected their development and has resulted in a remarkable homogeneity of construction although architecture varies. Schools, shopping centers and churches are located in the adjacent Euclid Ave. section. Some sales resistance is created by the fact that children from this area must cross Euclid Ave. to school. The rather steep hill from Euclid Ave. up to this plateau area is objectionable to housewives who must shop in Euclid Ave. section. Future for this area, according to informed realtor's opinion, should continue to hold its own and improve slightly with additional construction which will in all probability, proceed at a good place during the next few years.

BROOKWOOD was platted about 1924-25. Utilities and paving installed about 1928. Building was heaviest during 1929. An unusual situation in this area is the fact that expensive homes are intermingled with a few cheap homes (as low as $3000) constructed prior to platting and restrictions now in effect, namely: $6000 on side streets and $10,000 on lake front (exclusive of lot). Average lot is 50 ft. x 170 ft.; all streets improved. The presence of less desirable homes does not appear to detrimentally affect property value since their removal will eventually be accomplished. No additions being permitted. FULLERWOOD was platted about 1928 into lots 50 ft. x 158 ft. All streets have utilities installed. Only 25 homes are located in this beautiful wooded section. Lots originally sold for $60-$75 per front foot. Minimum restriction for homes (exclusive of lot) is $6500. Homes built are much more expensive. Development has been slow in this area due to rather high special assessments which, however, pay out this year. Lthough only 5% built up, the existing restrictions and beautiful appearance of this part of area will, undoubtedly, become a first grade neighborhood when development becomes substantial. HOMESITE was platted about 1924-25 into 40 ft. x 140 ft. restricted to $5000 (house and lot) and has the older homes in this whole area. However, new construction has been better than restrictions but lack of uniformity in set-back has damaged the appearance of some streets, particularly along E. 265th. Location of schools in this area holds property value. Although most homes are frame, new construction is primarily brick. Area is also beautifully wooded. FOREST PARK, a small subdivision, is entirely new and at present consists of 18 homes built last year ranging in price from $6750 to $7950. Construction is excellent; homes are predominantly of brick, gas heated and restrictions are strongly enforced by developer who intends to build 40 more houses on the two new streets being installed south of Shoreview bewteen E. 260th and E. 277th St. Price range of these homes will be from $6500 to $7500. On the whole, this area will maintain its general desirability due to the fact that beach privilaeges and actual home ownership are entirely dependent upon the approval of purchasers by other residents in community. This, in fact, is far more stringent than restrictions on home construction. Rentals are almost non-existent. The one detrimental feature to this neighborhood is its only fair transportation.

Sales prices haev declined approximately 5-10% since 1937 but will, in all probability, remain firm and follow only obsolescence of property since character of occupants is of stable home-owning type.","9":"Lakewood 3rd C-10 9/8/39","10":"","71":"8","72":"23.5","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Factory workers","1c":"75 Slovak - Hungarian - Bohemian - Polish","1d":"0","1e":"of second generation - foreign","2a":"2-family houses, 5 rm. suites 2-story 1-family singles, 6-rooms","2b":"Frame Frame","2c":"18 years 18 years","2d":"Fairly good Fairly good","2e":"98% 98%","2f":"50% 75%","2g":"7000-8500 5000-6500","2h":"6500-8000 -7 4500-6000 -9","2i":"Aug. 1939 6500-8000 0 4500-6000 0","2j":"Fairly good Good","2k":"Firm Firm","2l":"30-45 40-55","2m":"30-45 0 40-55 0","2n":"Aug. 1939 30-45 0 40-55 0","2o":"Good Good","2p":"Firm Firm","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"","5a":"","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.800664,41.453183],[-81.802415,41.452843],[-81.802593,41.453938],[-81.801345,41.454259],[-81.797174,41.455087],[-81.796711,41.457572],[-81.796889,41.458801],[-81.797602,41.459603],[-81.798065,41.460324],[-81.794679,41.462675],[-81.794607,41.464866],[-81.798315,41.466202],[-81.798351,41.46671],[-81.800312,41.467725],[-81.800775,41.468152],[-81.80049,41.468606],[-81.799242,41.46874],[-81.797923,41.46858],[-81.79721,41.468232],[-81.797139,41.468633],[-81.797139,41.470236],[-81.792326,41.470236],[-81.789652,41.470209],[-81.788653,41.470663],[-81.782771,41.470663],[-81.782379,41.470503],[-81.782379,41.469782],[-81.78466,41.469541],[-81.787798,41.465641],[-81.789972,41.465668],[-81.790151,41.463504],[-81.790757,41.46353],[-81.795712,41.460458],[-81.794643,41.456236],[-81.794857,41.454312],[-81.800664,41.453183]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C11","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"95 ","3":"0  ","5":"","6":"Available up to 80%","8":"This area was originally laid out in 1918 by the Knight-Norris-Gibbs Co.; now 30% built up; 70% dirt streets; 30% paved; average lot front 40 ft.; all utilities installed; transportation is fair only (bus service on Triskett and Fischer Rd.); good school facilities, convenient to churches; a few retail stores on Fischer Rd. Only nominal restrictions in some sections of area and none in others. As a result, the area was improved with cheap cottage type homes. J. S. Bradley Realty Co.

If streets east of W. 140th were paved, new construction would average about 25 homes per year.

The area is fairly well built up, however, and homes are beginning to show age. The entire length of the southeasterly boundary of area borders closely with industry and prevailing winds carry smoke and dirt to that lane of properties lying nearby. The Industrial Rayon Corporation is located at Walford and W. 98th St. (southcentral part of area); entire residential section surrounding the Rayon Plant suffers badly from chemical fumes -- so strong that it deteriorates house paint and, therefore, creates a strong sales resistance. A few years ago the Rayon Corporation was compelled to elevate its smoke stacks and install other eliminating processes in order to avoid continuation of this nuisance. Although some improvement is noted in the immediate surrounding area, it must be said that the higher stacks have a tendency to spread a thin layer of fumes over a wider area, i.e. with southerly wind, the fumes affect area as far as Edgewater and Lakewood.","9":"West Cleveland 3rd C-17 9/6/39","10":"","71":"8","72":"30.2","1a":"Slightly  ","1b":"White-collared - Artisans - Few laborers","1c":"15 English - Irish - German - Hungarian - Bohemian","1d":"","1e":"Above nationalities moving in slowly","2a":"2-story singles, 5-7 rms. 2-family, 4-6 rooms","2b":"Frame Frame","2c":"15-17 years 15-17 years","2d":"Fair to good Fair to good","2e":"97% 97%","2f":"80% 40%","2g":"3250-6500 4500-10,000","2h":"3250-6500 0 4500-10,000 0","2i":"Aug. 1939 3500-6500 3 5000-10,000 4","2j":"Good Good","2k":"Firm to upward Firm to upward","2l":"20-50 20-45","2m":"20-50 0 20-45 0","2n":"Aug. 1939 25-50 7 25-45 7","2o":"Good Good","2p":"Upward Upward","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"","5a":"","5b":""}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.762375,41.465142],[-81.762422,41.463325],[-81.765845,41.46206],[-81.765595,41.461446],[-81.765631,41.461152],[-81.768804,41.461099],[-81.768837,41.460476],[-81.769517,41.460431],[-81.776291,41.458454],[-81.776541,41.45832],[-81.776576,41.457598],[-81.77868,41.457492],[-81.778715,41.459896],[-81.774972,41.461072],[-81.774794,41.461339],[-81.775899,41.463183],[-81.783172,41.461072],[-81.78335,41.45856],[-81.780284,41.459389],[-81.78007,41.459282],[-81.780141,41.454285],[-81.782209,41.454205],[-81.782102,41.45653],[-81.790338,41.453804],[-81.790267,41.455087],[-81.787414,41.456022],[-81.787379,41.459736],[-81.786523,41.459709],[-81.786594,41.462087],[-81.783279,41.46206],[-81.783136,41.462301],[-81.782922,41.465373],[-81.772833,41.463797],[-81.772512,41.469033],[-81.768626,41.469033],[-81.76859,41.470316],[-81.762315,41.470316],[-81.762375,41.465142]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C18","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"70 20","3":"10-12 $5500-5800 Owner-contracted","5":"","6":"Ample","8":"Level topography with slight incline from W. 110th to W. 115th; eastern section of area platted in 1910, western section in 1917-1918; now 70% built up; average lot front 40 ft.; paved streets; all utilities installed; good transportation; good school and store facilities.

Future for this area \"should continue to hold its own\" and development will be normal. Jennings Rd. project will also influence this section favorably (new thoroughfare short-cut to downtown). Area is fairly convenient to stores, schools and churches (mostly along Pearl Rd.).","9":"Cleveland (W. side) (Formerly Brooklyn) 3rd C-27 9/13/39","10":"","71":"8","72":"30.20","1a":"Slowly  ","1b":"Moderate income mechanics - White-collared - Craftsmen","1c":"10 German - Hungarian","1d":"0","1e":"Occupants of 3rd grade area to north slowly moving here.","2a":"Singles, 5-6 rooms 2-family, 5 rooms per unit","2b":"Frame Frame","2c":"12-15 years 12-15 years","2d":"Fair to good Fair to good","2e":"99% 98%","2f":"85% 60%","2g":"4500-6500 5500-8500","2h":"4500-6500 0 5500-8500 0","2i":"Aug. 1939 4500-6500 0 5500-8500 0","2j":"Good Good","2k":"Stable Stable","2l":"30-50 30-45","2m":"30-47.50 -3 30-40 -7","2n":"Aug. 1939 30-50 3 30-45 7","2o":"Good Good","2p":"Firm to slightly up Firm to slightly up","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"75","5a":"","5b":"30"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.710449,41.419106],[-81.710449,41.417359],[-81.710449,41.411013],[-81.710449,41.408197],[-81.710449,41.401137],[-81.712162,41.401073],[-81.71243,41.403993],[-81.741961,41.404238],[-81.741961,41.405842],[-81.736049,41.405909],[-81.73593,41.407892],[-81.739109,41.409274],[-81.740981,41.410789],[-81.741813,41.410945],[-81.745051,41.411168],[-81.751944,41.41246],[-81.752328,41.412796],[-81.751615,41.414115],[-81.744437,41.412511],[-81.744247,41.418535],[-81.734074,41.418749],[-81.727514,41.418322],[-81.717722,41.418856],[-81.710449,41.419106]],[[-81.733171,41.411584],[-81.733266,41.40563],[-81.722856,41.405666],[-81.723141,41.411619],[-81.733171,41.411584]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C28","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"95 ","3":"4 Singles, $6000 Owner-contracted","5":"","6":"Limited to available","8":"This area is 35% built up; 80% of streets paved; trees along most streets; average lot front 40 ft.; good transportation - by bus on Pearl Rd. and by street car on Brook Park Rd.; convenient to schools, churches and stores.

This community, through the depression hard hit by unemployment, presented a rather shoddy appearance due to lack of maintenance but within the last 24 months has seen a 25% improvement because of considerable repairing and remodeling. Area has had no new construction since the depression. The industrial area, abutting west boundary of area, formerly housed the Interstate Plant which moved from area and caused considerable unemployment to residents of this section, many of whom lost thier homes by foreclosure. Most all of these properties have been resold to second generation of Bohemian, Russian, Polish and Hungarian stock. Transportation in area is poor, but schools, stores and churches are located within area. The industrial plant abutting west boundary has been purchased by several small companies which provide employment to residents of this area. No program of new construction is anticipated for this section but it should remain stable for the next few years. The northerly portion of area, east of Broadway along Pinecrest Dr. and Edgecliff was an attempted subdivision in the $10,000-$15,000 bracket which failed because of neighborhood disadvantages (proximity to cheaper homes on south side of highway -- fumes and smoke from distillery to north and inability of promoters to carry subdivision).

Original development began about 15-18 years ago but lacked proper control and uniform restrictions which resulted in spotty development such as garage structures on rear of lot by laborers with small earning power. The section north of Turney Rd. is more sparsely developed and consists of better type homes than that portion south of Turney Rd. (Corkhill). The recent trend has been the abandonment of the cheap, cottage garage type homes partially die to condemnation by Maple Heights officials. The area on the whole, however, is desirable from a renting standpoint, although practically no building activity has occurred in the past 7-8 years. The Corkhill Section consists of slightly cheaper homes and development here is about 18%. Lots in the whole area average about 40 ft. x 120 ft. and, at the present time, can be bought for $200 to $500. Approximately 15% of the streets are paved, principally such thoroughfares as Turney Rd., Rockside and Dunham. However, the northwest area bounded by Rockside and Dunham is paved; other streets in the area are graded and slagged. Majority of streets have sidewalks; all utilities available in area except for gas. Transportation is only fair- half hour schedule during rush, on the hour normal.

The westerly portion of area is fairly well built up, but area as a whole is only developed 10%. All streets are paved and utilities in with the exception of the easterly projections which lack gas and have a few graded slag streets with cement sidewalks. Main arteries for this area are Broadway and Lee Rd. (westerly part), Libby and Raymond (east-west). A concentration of approx. eight 2-family homes are located on Paine Ave. (Near Broadway). Balance of area contains only a few 2-family houses. Schools, churches, stores and transportation (15 min. rush - half hour normal) are convenient to westerly part of area but distant to easterly projections of area. Future development in this area will be slow and will be located principally in the western part near Broadway and Lee Rd. because of proximity to transportation and other facilities. Development in this area is mostly of 1 1/2 sty. dwellings, cheap homes, and some cottages. Commercial district lies on Broadway and at the intersection of Lee and Libby Rds. On the whole, future development in this area will, probably, be of better type homes than those present as indicated by the slight construction during the past 3 yrs. However future for area will be uncertain until the abutting 15% built up 2nd grade neighborhood is heavily developed.

Opinion of local realtors is that new construction will avoid this area is preference to that lying farther south.","9":"Garfield Hts. 3rd C-41 9-13-39","10":"","71":"8","72":"29.00","1a":"Very slowly  ","1b":"Factory workers - some office workers (white collared)","1c":"50 Polish - Bohemian - Italian","1d":"0","1e":"Hardly any -- mostly same type coming in","2a":"5-6 rm singles 5-6 rm doubles","2b":"Frame Frame","2c":"12 yrs. 12 yrs.","2d":"Only fair Fair","2e":"98% 98%","2f":"60% 55%","2g":"4000-6500 5500-9000","2h":"3750-6200 -5 5250-8750 -4","2i":"1939 3600-5900 -5 5000-8500 -4","2j":"Fair Fair","2k":"Firm Firm","2l":"35-45 27.50-42.50","2m":"30-42.50 -9 22.50-37.50 -10","2n":"1939 32.50-47.50 10 27.50-42.50 10","2o":"Good Good","2p":"Firm Firm","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"50","5a":"","5b":"20"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.581242,41.434942],[-81.581242,41.425747],[-81.576916,41.425783],[-81.576868,41.431022],[-81.574297,41.43105],[-81.570213,41.431093],[-81.570356,41.429668],[-81.567694,41.429454],[-81.567741,41.424428],[-81.577153,41.424428],[-81.581859,41.424428],[-81.586613,41.427814],[-81.602252,41.432198],[-81.6023,41.434123],[-81.597309,41.434051],[-81.597404,41.434693],[-81.592935,41.434693],[-81.592603,41.4312],[-81.590796,41.43063],[-81.590131,41.431485],[-81.5888,41.432305],[-81.587088,41.432626],[-81.586518,41.432947],[-81.586661,41.433695],[-81.586661,41.43423],[-81.586233,41.434408],[-81.584522,41.434479],[-81.584664,41.435121],[-81.581242,41.434942]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C42","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"95 ","3":"0 - -","5":"1","6":"Available","8":"This partly wooded hilly section is developed about 10% and homes are concentrated mostly along Dressler Rd., Forestdale and area south to Broadway - balance of area (north of Dressler to Granwood Blvd. and part of east of E. 143rd) is undeveloped.

The area lies on a plateau separated from the 4th grade area to the north and east bu a picturesque park-ravine. Home development in this 85% built-up neighborhood first began about 1915 and was very heavy until 1921, became dormant until 1924, and then proceeded steadily until 1929. After 1929 area again lay dormant until within the last 18 mos. when new construction of single homes started (all owner-contracted). This area's development (both 2-families and singles) has been of sound construction, but lack of proper restrictions has permitted the intermingling of singles ( 1 1/2 & 2-story types) with 2-family structures. With the exception of the small southwesterly corner, homes have been well-kept and area, in informed realtor's opinion, has a very high ratio of unincumbered properties.

Employment is nearby to the south and west (American Steel, U.S. Aluminum Co., & Republic Steel). Most occupants of this area are long-service and salaried employees.

Most of this area has lain dormant for approximately 10 years, principally due to only fair fire protection, poor transportation and high assessment on paved streets (50% in area), particularly Judson Blvd. However, within the last year there has been some building activity in the southeastern part known as City Allotment. A small scattering of two family houses are located in area. The northern part, east of Lee Rd., is unpaved as is most of the southwestern part and better development lies in the southeastern and northwestern parts. Within the past year many lots have been put up for sale by Sheriff for taxes. Assessments will expire within the next year and in many instances respread will probably be necessary. School facilities for this district are only one grade school which is also heavily attended by colored children from 4th grade area - D-10. Stores for this area are located at the intersection of Lee Rd. and Miles. Church and high school facilities are distant. Fire and police protection for area are patrolled by units two miles distant, located at E. 131st. This area's future appears more favorable due to some building activity within the past year but on the whole, no large amount of construction is anticipated for the next 3 to 5 years.","9":"Cleveland (E. side) 3rd C-48 9/13/39","10":"","71":"8","72":"30.20","1a":"Slowly  ","1b":"Factory workers - Mechanics - Some office workers - Craftsmen","1c":"35 Better type Hungarian & Czech","1d":"","1e":"Second generation of foreign descent into new homes","2a":"Singles, 5-6 rooms ","2b":"Frame ","2c":"12-20 years ","2d":"Fairly good ","2e":"98% ","2f":"80% ","2g":"2000-5000 ","2h":"2000-4500 -8  ","2i":"Sept. 1939 2000-5500 15  ","2j":"Only fair ","2k":"Firm ","2l":"20-37.50 ","2m":"20-35 -4  ","2n":"Aug. 1939 20-40 9  ","2o":"Fair ","2p":"Stable ","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"20","5a":"","5b":"20"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.606271,41.469052],[-81.606747,41.469097],[-81.606747,41.467227],[-81.605618,41.467271],[-81.60538,41.463576],[-81.602944,41.463576],[-81.602944,41.46077],[-81.591001,41.460859],[-81.590763,41.463531],[-81.588921,41.463531],[-81.584405,41.464377],[-81.584345,41.452309],[-81.580008,41.452398],[-81.57977,41.457564],[-81.572402,41.457342],[-81.571747,41.457334],[-81.572046,41.449726],[-81.572151,41.446929],[-81.572721,41.446644],[-81.574765,41.445825],[-81.576477,41.444684],[-81.578045,41.4439],[-81.583607,41.445254],[-81.590928,41.445326],[-81.590934,41.445602],[-81.590975,41.44725],[-81.596917,41.447179],[-81.59706,41.448818],[-81.602812,41.449103],[-81.602812,41.451454],[-81.61018,41.451597],[-81.610512,41.453948],[-81.612224,41.453913],[-81.612366,41.458865],[-81.613555,41.459043],[-81.61346,41.466452],[-81.613079,41.46663],[-81.610132,41.466951],[-81.608516,41.466951],[-81.608516,41.467343],[-81.608611,41.467913],[-81.609086,41.46834],[-81.609609,41.468625],[-81.609324,41.469551],[-81.609392,41.469959],[-81.606271,41.469052]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C49","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"65% 30%","3":"10 $5000-5500 Owner-contracted","5":"1","6":"Available","8":"This large residential area, heavily populated by second generation of Bohemian descent, began its first development in the west part about 25 years ago and its central and eastern park about 20 years ago, with the exception of East Blvd (in western part) which was platted and sold 15 years ago.

This section has excellent transportation, church, stre and school facilities (four grade and three junior high schools). All streets are paved and assessments are paid up. Adverse influence to this area, however, is its attractiveness to Jewish, Italian and colored residents in 4th grade area immediately to the north who have maintained constant pressure to get into this section. Their infiltration, although strongly resisted, has partly succeeded, principially south along E. 142, 143, 144, and 146th Sts.

Occupancy here began with an extremely heavy infiltration of Russian-Jewish from the downtown 4th grade area around Woodland-55th between the years of 1920-30. The older 4th grade area lying to the west has steadily moved east into this section due to the colored encroachment in that 4th grade area, which also threatens this section although exclusion of Negro occupancy has been restricted to the 4th grade area as shown on map. The cheapness of construction has tended to increase the lack of property maintenance, also partly characteristic of the area. Lots in this area average 40' frontage and are developed about 70%. However, such streets as E. 147th & E. 149th are undeveloped except for the immediate vicinity of Kinsman (main thoroughfare and business center). Future for this section appears stable for only a short period due to present real estate conditions but all to appearances the pressure from advancing Negro and Italian infiltration into abutting 4th grade territory will, no doubt, spread into this section, although present western boundary of this area now marks the extent of their eastward movement.

From 1920 death blows to this area's values were: encircling heavy foreign infiltration into abutting areas, principally Russian-Jewish into section to the northeast; and most important, the almost total migration of wealthy families in this area to the exclusive Shaker Heights subdivision between 1920-30. Then too, original restrictions to residential use on Wade allotments are at expiration point now. Virtually 90% of the original owners of these large homes have moved from this section. This has had a detrimental effect also on the market value of smaller single-family homes which are lcoated in the northerly portion of area. Because of the proximity of these large homes to the college buildings abutting south boundary, many of them have been converted into rooming houses, boarding houses and small educational institutions in themselves, such as: music schools, art schools and fraternity houses. At present it is estimated these fine homes, some costing $300,000, now bring 10¢ or less on the original dollar cost. Exorbitant maintenance prevents ready rental of these large homes but, in many cases, owners have made nominal leases for educational or institutional use. Properties in the northern part abutting the park do not follow in this latter class but because of their obsolescence, size, and large lots have been thrown into this category. Property values in area will, eventually, stabilize for the smaller single family homes with the absorption of large homes now on the market. The beautiful park abutting this fully built up section enhances the possibility of this area becoming an exclusive apartment site (one solid block of aprtments now located on East Blvd. between Ashbury and Superior.)","9":"Cleveland (E. side) (Wade Estates & Park Section) High 3rd C-53 9/12/39","10":"","71":"8","72":"30.20","1a":"  Yes","1b":"College students - Some teachers - Musicians - Public Service & office workers","1c":"5 Italian","1d":"1 family","1e":"Increasing occupancy of students attending nearby colleges","2a":"Singles, 8-9 rooms Old mansions converted into boarding houses","2b":"Frame - Some brick 10-15 rooms, Brick & stone","2c":"25-35 years 25-35 years","2d":"Fair Fair","2e":"98% 80%","2f":"60% 30%","2g":"5500-8500 17,500-35,000","2h":"5000-8000 -7 15,000-30,000 -14","2i":"Aug. 1939 5000-8000 0 15,000-25,000 -11","2j":"Poor Very poor","2k":"Slowly down Down","2l":"40-65 *See remarks","2m":"40-65 0 \"  \" ","2n":"Aug. 1939 40-65 0 \"  \" ","2o":"Fair Hardly any","2p":"Firm No change - see remarks","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"25","5a":"","5b":"10"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.62066,41.515896],[-81.636875,41.515729],[-81.639489,41.518354],[-81.639668,41.525828],[-81.63842,41.525917],[-81.638361,41.52734],[-81.633132,41.529787],[-81.632716,41.52912],[-81.630933,41.529698],[-81.630637,41.529803],[-81.629784,41.527967],[-81.629101,41.528145],[-81.627972,41.526499],[-81.628536,41.525943],[-81.627437,41.524586],[-81.626605,41.524786],[-81.625803,41.523452],[-81.626249,41.523007],[-81.618673,41.519381],[-81.61897,41.517846],[-81.62066,41.515896]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C54","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"70 25","3":"0  ","5":"1","6":"Limited","8":"This area contains a large foreign population (predominantly Polish) of strong church-going, lome-loving character.

Balance of area was developed 15-20 years ago, predominantly with singles north of Gray Ave. to St. Clair and heavily mixed with two families (lots 40' x 125') south of Brackland west of E. 128th, now worth $6000 to $6500 except Thornhill Dr. which is solidly built up with large 6 rm. suite two families on 50'x150' lots in the $8500 to $9000 class. A heavy influx of Jewish 2nd & 3rd generations began in the southern part of this section (so. of Brackland and east of E. 128th) between 1920-30 and has continued steadily from that time. Balance of area is predominantly American with mixture of 2nd generation foreign) except for small concentration of Jewish no.of St. Clair on E. 115th, E. 117th and E. 118th. Property values have remained stable since recovery from depression lows about 1935 and future trend appears favorable, although the probability of continued Jewish infiltration may have a detrimental effects. However, the location of Lutheran and Catholic churches in northern part will tend to arrest this infiltration due to their hold on property owners in their parish.

Lacking any building restrictions, the early construction consisted mostly of garages with one or two rooms for living purposes -- \"a working man's garden plot homesite\". Now 50% built up with small single residences and cottages. However, not all of the early landmarks have disappeared; approximately 15% of the old, cheap, temporary built homes (without basements) still remain scattered throughout area. Streets are either paved or hard surfaced; average lot 50' x 150'-200'; transportation is limited due to outlying location of area; all utilities installed; public school located in the area. Starting from scratch, the area is being slowly transformed into a fair residential neighborhood with some appeal to the factory and laboring man. Twelve new homes built within past year along W. 226th and W. 227th. Very little development west of municipal limits. Many of the early owners located here, principally, because they could purchase large lots at low cost. As the area developed, several improvements were installed running up the special assessments to a high cost per lot with the result that a good number of the early owners were forced to give up their properties. In addition to these assessments there is a school tax of approximately $12.00 per year. The situation has been somewhat improved through the expiration of some of the special assessments and also because in later years a slightly 'higher-wage-earning class' had settled here.

Other streets in the area are developed, predominantly, with single homes occasionally mixed with a bungalow or semi-bungalow, such as: Lilac and Laurel. Area between Dill and Dorsh (southeast corner) consists of two large estates. This area, at the present time, is about 18% developed when consideration is given to unplatted acreage, but existing streets are built up about 75%; schools, stores, churches and transportation are located along Mayfield Rd. Future of area appears stable for the next several years but will depend on the strength of restrictions for each street developed, since area as a whole lacks both uniformity in lot size and development.

The area has lain dormant, with the exception of a few streets in the western part, such as: Eastover, Mayview, Willshire, Oakmont and Haverford which have been built up in the last 3 yrs. with single homes in the $6000-$7500 bracket. The development of the first 3 streets mentioned was a speculative building resulting in uniform well-priced homes which sold well and, will probably result in continued activity by this builder. The portion of area north of Mayfield Rd. and east of Irene is only slightly developed; Beaconfield, Sunview and Haverstown are open field; Brainard is unpaved but utilities in - no houses. Balance of this northeastern portion has paved streets and utilities; 5 new homes built on Gordon (Croydon developed with only 4 houses.) The Central-northern portion of area (shown unplatted on map) has recently been broken into 5 acre parcels developed with 8 homes ranging from $8000-$15,000; only 3 such parcels remain for construction of homes. Stores for area are located on Mayfield Rd. between Irene and Churchill, grade school at intersection of Richmond and Mayfield, high school is located in extreme western portion of area and churches are distant (Green Rd. and Mayfield in South Euclid); transportation is good (15 min. rush, half hour regular). The future for this 3rd grade area, now approx. 10% built up, will depend much on a \"street by street\" basis for future development and restrictions.

The topography of area is level north of Euclid but rises to the south of Euclid in two fairly steep inclines. Development began about 30 yrs. ago with the location of the General Electric factories which abut south boundary of area. Lots are predominantly 40 front feet but vary in depth south of Euclid due to a hilly terrain; however, average depth may be stated as 120-150 ft. The area also varies in types of construction; north of Euclid development is approx. 75% small singles ($4000-5000 bracket), 25% two-family $6800-7500 bracket). The portion of area between Euclid Ave. south to Endora is almost wholly developed with two-family structures ($7000-7800 bracket); thus the part of area south of Euclid is 75% two-family, 25% singles -- 5-6 rms. (price bracket $5500-7000). Industrial lands (including NYC RR) abuts entire north boundary of area. This neighborhood is virtually fully built-up, only 4-5% of land shown vacant on map is suitable for home construction. In the past 10 yrs. a steady influx of lower income group, mostly Italian, has found its way into the cheaper properties north of Euclid Ave. Community, as a whole, shows lack of maintenance and, although prices asked for homes (particularly two-families) are considerably above \"income return\", realtors opinion is that this 3rd grade neighborhood will continue to decline. Chief deterrent to sales south of Euclid is winter car driving hazard encountered in traversing steep double incline.","9":"Cleveland (E. side), Colonial Hills 3rd C-64 9-26-39","10":"","71":"8","72":"30.20","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Factory workers - office clerks","1c":"30 Italian - others mixed","1d":"0","1e":"Influx of Italian and lower income families","2a":"Up and down, 2-family (5 rm suites) Mixed type, Singles (5-6 rms)","2b":"Frame Frame","2c":"20 yrs. 20 yrs.","2d":"Fair Fair","2e":"95% 98%","2f":"90% 95%","2g":"7300-8500 4200-7500","2h":"6800-7800 -8 4000-7000 -6","2i":"1939 6800-7800 0 4000-7000 0","2j":"Fair Fair","2k":"Stable Stable","2l":"30-40 35-55","2m":"30-35 -7 35-50 -5","2n":"1939 30-35 0 35-50 0","2o":"Fair Fairly good","2p":"Stable Stable","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"25","5a":"","5b":"9"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.522211,41.573797],[-81.522197,41.57345],[-81.522803,41.573103],[-81.523338,41.572517],[-81.523944,41.572383],[-81.524586,41.57225],[-81.526796,41.571343],[-81.529328,41.570436],[-81.531894,41.569689],[-81.533534,41.569156],[-81.533962,41.568569],[-81.534176,41.568409],[-81.534711,41.568009],[-81.536494,41.566808],[-81.537135,41.566355],[-81.5371,41.566062],[-81.536208,41.565902],[-81.535852,41.565635],[-81.536458,41.565021],[-81.537456,41.564434],[-81.538561,41.564434],[-81.539774,41.564194],[-81.540415,41.563554],[-81.540059,41.562594],[-81.539809,41.56182],[-81.540665,41.561607],[-81.542661,41.5603],[-81.542992,41.560034],[-81.544123,41.559126],[-81.545977,41.557899],[-81.546155,41.557499],[-81.546583,41.557605],[-81.547688,41.558219],[-81.548722,41.559046],[-81.547581,41.559873],[-81.546369,41.56102],[-81.547082,41.56158],[-81.54833,41.562594],[-81.549293,41.563154],[-81.550255,41.563821],[-81.550933,41.564194],[-81.547082,41.566488],[-81.542661,41.563314],[-81.53874,41.566462],[-81.539881,41.567182],[-81.54177,41.568622],[-81.542947,41.569307],[-81.54104,41.570371],[-81.54064,41.570579],[-81.53956,41.569983],[-81.539132,41.569609],[-81.537492,41.569369],[-81.537028,41.568916],[-81.536565,41.568409],[-81.535709,41.568142],[-81.535103,41.568676],[-81.534675,41.569369],[-81.534996,41.569743],[-81.535567,41.570569],[-81.53546,41.571023],[-81.534568,41.57153],[-81.53275,41.571983],[-81.531217,41.57265],[-81.530896,41.572143],[-81.53054,41.571556],[-81.529827,41.571503],[-81.529007,41.57185],[-81.5289,41.57273],[-81.529541,41.573797],[-81.530005,41.574997],[-81.530148,41.576224],[-81.529969,41.576891],[-81.527794,41.576971],[-81.526297,41.576997],[-81.526297,41.576624],[-81.523908,41.576624],[-81.522233,41.576704],[-81.52234,41.576064],[-81.52234,41.575397],[-81.522233,41.574357],[-81.522211,41.573797]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C65","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"90 ","3":"0  -","5":"1","6":"Available","8":"This third grade area is the outlying development along Euclid Ave. from E. 193rd to 228th St. abutting and between vacant industrial land and railroad property on its northern border.

Age of neighborhood and mixture of cottages and small homes establish this neighborhood as a 3rd grade area which should remain stable for the next few years.","9":"Cleveland (E side) 3rd C-69 9/22/39","10":"","71":"8","72":"30.20","1a":"Slowly  ","1b":"White collared-Tradesmen-Some professional-small business owners","1c":"0 American Community","1d":"","1e":"None","2a":"6 room singles ","2b":"Frame ","2c":"20 years ","2d":"Fairly good ","2e":"100% ","2f":"80% ","2g":"4500-7000 ","2h":"4500-7000 0  ","2i":"Sept. 1939 4500-7000   ","2j":"Fairly good ","2k":"Stable ","2l":"40-60 ","2m":"40-60 0  ","2n":"Sept. 1939 40-60 0  ","2o":"Good ","2p":"Stable ","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"15","5a":"","5b":"10"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.831146,41.482607],[-81.832835,41.482935],[-81.834439,41.478438],[-81.835865,41.478483],[-81.835776,41.480375],[-81.838123,41.480442],[-81.838301,41.478394],[-81.840024,41.478238],[-81.839935,41.477103],[-81.843501,41.477103],[-81.8446,41.478795],[-81.844778,41.483825],[-81.840708,41.483647],[-81.840767,41.482067],[-81.844035,41.48102],[-81.844184,41.480598],[-81.843025,41.478706],[-81.840678,41.479551],[-81.84053,41.480664],[-81.837737,41.481466],[-81.837261,41.481221],[-81.834796,41.482445],[-81.835419,41.483558],[-81.832077,41.484526],[-81.831146,41.482607]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C7","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"50 40","3":"0  ","5":"","6":"Available to 50% of appr.","8":"This small third grade area surrounding the business and industrial section of Rocky River was platted some 40 yrs. ago.

The commercial district is centered amd restricted to the triangle formed by the thoroughfares; Franklin, Washington and Main Sts. Residential development varies somewhat, but generally along thoroughfares consists of the intermingling of newer homes ranging from 15-75 yrs; many of the old homes have been extensively remodeled, some into doubles. Lot frontage varies from 45-80 ft.; area has very few 30-35 ft. front lots. The northerly part, along Cottage and High Sts., contains the cheapest development; avg. age 65 yrs., price bracket $2500-$3500. The newer sections, active 1925-29, along such streets as Olive and Hall (SW part), E. Washington (SE part) and North St. (NE part) contain 6 rm. singles, avg. age 10-15 yrs., price bracket $3500-7000. Franklin St. is the elite section -- large old homes and lots; avg. age 50 yrs., price bracket $5000-9000, a few as high as $12,000.

Terrain is fairly level but residential development is centered mostly in the portion of area immediately south of the railroad yard area; the older cheaper development is along Old Main and Solon Rds. in the railroad yard area. This area suffered a severe setback during the late 20's when the over-allotment and improvement of streets (Bainbridge Rd. sub-div.) placed the community heavily in debt forcing the respread of a $350,000 bonded indebtedness over the whole village. At the present time there are approx. 2900 vacant lots. An additional drawback to this community is the absence of any local source of industrial employment; transportation to Cleveland industrial area (9 mi. distant) is only via combination morning and evening train service. School facilities consist of centralized grade and high school. In the past yrs., Solon has had little or no construction activity within this area but thoroughfares leading out of community have been developed with many cheap constructed small homes (36 in '38) some without basements. Zoning restrictions for the township, however, now prohibit this type of construction. Above mentioned heavy Village indebtedness resulted in many foreclosures. Over 100 of the approx. 400 dwelling structures changed hands between '28-'37 for this reason. Vacancy was also high, being estimated at 7% during '38 but now believed to be only about 3% due to low-rental housing demand in Metropolitan area. This community has had only negligible development except for the period between '18-'28 and due to the aforementioned factors will progress very slowly at best during the next few years. Area is accorded a weak 3rd grade rating.

Almost immediately the commercial district along Kinsman became solidly Jewish-owned and a heavy infiltration of Russian-Jewish and Italian occurred between 1920-30 and although slower since then has continued up to date. Beginning with about 1928 a movement of colored from the downtown areas started in this section and progressed with moderate success up until about 3 years ago when the movement became more pronounced, and at present is continuing steadily. The heavy slump in price valuation in property in this area occurring following the depression made some recovery up to 1937 with improved general business conditions but is again sliding due to lack of maintenance and constant infiltration from these elements. A boom of commercial property along Kinsman Rd. was experienced in 1928 but collapsed and did not materially affect residential property values. This area throughout shows poor maintenance and rapid depreciation of property is characteristic of these inhabitants. Informed realtor's opinion is that this section should have been, at the outset, developed for colored occupancy as an overflow outlet for the dtrong movement that has progressed into the northeastern part of Cleveland. However no concerted effort was made and the present occupancy has resulted from the normal characteristic of colored infiltration into Jewish & Italian neighborhoods with the obsolescence of property due to lack of maintenance. The apparent future for this area will be an increasing occupancy ratio by Jewish, Italian and colored with a steady fall in price value.","9":"Cleveland (E. side) (Kinsman - Mt.

Industrial property and railroads virtually surround this area except that part of southwesterly boundary abutting Washington Park. Most of the inhabitants here are employed by Republic, Otis, U.S. Steel and Aluminum Co. of America (abutting area.) The area is distinguished by its heavy concentration of 2-family homes, not located in any particular section but grouped in sets of 10-12 -- apparently built in rows by contractors. Several long one-floor plan singles (approx. 5% of total) have been converted into 2-family utility. Here and there pride of ownership is evident in inexpensive improvement, such as new lawns and upkeep of shrubbery but on the whole, limited income of these residents leaves much to be desired in renovation. The small commercial structures are scattered along thorofares of Broadway, Fleet, Aetna and Harvard. Area has good transportation, school and social centers, such as lodges and halls; two large Polish Catholic Churches are located in 3rd grade neighborhood surrounded by this area. Main shopping center for this district is located in 4th grade area to the north along Broadway. This fully built-up section, although old and detrimentally affected by smoke, soot, fumes and dirt, is stable due to the type of inhabitants, (Polish), high home ownership ratio and proximity of employment.

Up until 12 years ago it was almost solidly occupied by Hungarian and Slovak population but with the lessening of industrial activity and lack of upkeep in dwellings, a steady movement of Hungarian families from this neighborhood brought an immediate infiltration of colored from the Outhwaite section lying to the northwest. This infiltration has continued, principally, along Kinsman in the northwestern part of area. At present, property values have virtually reached their maximum depreciation and sales are almost at a standstill except for speculative purposes by owners with purpose of renting to colored in mind for higher rental income. Responsibility for this change was hastened by the electrification of the New York Central RR lines, which in many cases made dead-end streets, and the closing of factories in the depression following '29. The general detriments caused by proximity to industry are all apparent and the lack of upkeep in property will continue to attract colored occupancy. The main thoroughfare for this district is Kinsman Rd. along which commercial property is scattered. The only possible improvement or change from the present rate of colored infiltration would be the renewal of industrial activity which would attract white factory workers back to this area thus creating a market for the sale of heavy institutional holdings. Social facilities are noticeably lacking in this area consisting of one grade school and one junior high and a few churches. Area is 99% built up.

At the time being, the area is zoned for apartments, commerce and grade \"B\" (light) industrial. Future for this area lies only in the enhancement of land value for industrial and commercial use.","9":"Cleveland (E. side) (NE downtown) 4th D-19 9-1-39","10":"","71":"8","72":"30.20","1a":" Steadily ","1b":"Factory workers","1c":"80 Slavish","1d":"Only a few families","1e":"Moving out of old residents with gradual demolition of property ","2a":"6 rm singles 8-15 rm converted singles to 3-4 family utility","2b":"Frame Frame","2c":"60-75 yrs. 60-75 yrs.","2d":"Poor Poor","2e":"100% 100%","2f":"60% 50%","2g":"2500-4500 4500-5500","2h":"2000-4000 -14 4000-5000 -10","2i":"1939 2000-4000 0 4000-5000 0","2j":"Poor Poor","2k":"Slowly downward Downward","2l":"15-30 8-20 per un.","2m":"15-30 0 8-20 0","2n":"1939 15-30 0 8-20 0","2o":"Good Fair","2p":"Stable Stable","4a":"(See Census Tract Map attached)","4b":"50","5a":"","5b":"12"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.769268,41.430767],[-81.769069,41.428294],[-81.770079,41.428294],[-81.770257,41.427492],[-81.770673,41.426779],[-81.771327,41.426601],[-81.774713,41.42669],[-81.774595,41.424997],[-81.773287,41.424774],[-81.774357,41.423749],[-81.790044,41.424017],[-81.790044,41.425977],[-81.784099,41.429911],[-81.78089,41.431916],[-81.780748,41.431061],[-81.769268,41.430767]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"D2","holc_grade":"D","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"70 30","3":"0  ","5":"","6":"Very limited to not available","8":"This allotment, known as \"Old Lindale\", was laid out in 1910 with 25'-40' lots; it is not approximately 50% built up; 40% of streets are paved, remainder dirt and slag (WPA slagged several streets this year); gas, water, light and sewer available to homes already constructed; bus transportation 92o minute service during day) on W. 130th which runs north and south to center of area (W. 130th is scheduled for widening and new pavement in 1940 from the point just completed this year at the railraod (Area C-16) through to Wooster Pike).

Portion of area from Hough Ave. to the south was once a fashionable section of large old mansions now depopulated by the owners and many have been converted into boarding houses and sanatoriums which the balance habe been torn down to make way for commercial and apartment structures. The portion of area north of Hough Ave. was formerly the district of business owners and high grade factory workers, which, due to age and infiltration, has now gained a heavy foreign occupancy. The large single homes and heavy development antedated the two family structure popularity so that at present only approximately 10% of the buildings are of the up-and-down 2-family type. This area also falls into two rental medium groups -- south of Hough Ave. rental medium is approximately $35-45; north of Hough rentals are $25-35. The area has gone rapidly to commercial structures along its main arteries such as: St. Clair, Superior, Wade Park, Hough and Euclid. The aoutheastern corner of area includes the largest shopping and commerical center east of the downtown business district at the intersection of E. 105th and Euclid. Stability of area, particularly southern part, depends primarily on its potential growth as the largest apartment section immediately east of the downtown area. As for the central and northern part, gradual obsolescence of single-family homes hold very little except a slow declining future.

Prior to the World War, and as early as 1910, this area had only a scattering of colored occupancy in the northwest corner.  At that time and up until 1920 a change of ownership principally to Russian-Jewish occurred.  From the period of 1920-30 colored infiltration came very strongly along the thoroughfare of Cedar in the north and Quiney in the south (almost totally colored now).  There is a concentration of Hungarians along Buckeye Rd. and of Italians in the extreme easterly part of district.  This area contains the southern portion of the very large commercial and shopping district centered at E. 105th and Euclid.  Large old mansions located on Cedar and Carnegie have been converted into rooming houses or are being torn down to make way for commercial structures.  Business is scattered throughout along Carnegie, Cedar, Quincy, Buckeye and Woodhill Rd.  There is also a commercial center at Buckeye and Woodhill Rd.  The portion of area lying east of Woodhill Rd. is considerably newer.  Development here has been predominantly of two-family structure -- occupancy heavily Italian -- no colored.  Area includes Lunn Park section recently purchased for government housing project now underway.  This small portion of area has been the scene of violent crime and gangster activity, particularly during prohibition days.  The trend for this area (now about 99% built up) is definitely downward since colored infiltration from 4th grade area to the west will continue strongly (very heavy during the past 3 years).

The ratio of singles and two-family homes varies on either side of St. Clair Ave., the main artery through this section. This ratio, north of St. Clair is 70% singles and 30% two-family and south of St. Clair is 60% singles and 40% two-family. Homes north of St. Clair range in age up to 45 years, the oldest of which were originally built without foundations and utilities and have since been remodeled. Properties south of St. Clair are considerably newer and range up to 30 yrs. with two families somewhat newer. Racial occupancy in this primarily industrial neighborhood also varies being almost solidly Italian south of St. Clair and East of Ivanhoe R. and heavily Slav north of St. Clair. Area suffered heavily during the depression, due to its predominancy of factory workers, and foreclosures were heavy. However, with the upturn in business during 1935-36 institutional sales on small down payment basis have been satisfactory. Property values in area have not recovered sharply because of the limited income of prospective purchasers who, through broken employment in such nearby industries as Fisher Body (abutting west boundary), New York Central Railroad Shop, Briggs and Apox Mfg. comapnies and various other industries, has not permitted the accumulation of more than a small down payment which prevents real estate transaction other than by institutions in liquidation. Example: Many of the 600 employees recently recalled to the Collinwoord Railroad shops, from a lay-off since July lived in this section. This fully built up industrial section will remain much the same for the next few years because of its advantageous location to nearby industries and transportation and occupancy desirability for the low income group. A slow infiltration of Italian may occur, although the area has had little shifting of population inside its boundaries.","9":"Cleveland (E side) (Formerly Collinwood) 4th D-25 9-15-39","10":"","71":"1938","72":"60","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Factory - Railroad Shop Workers - Craftsmen - Cement & stone workers","1c":"80% Italtian & Slay","1d":"2 families","1e":"Slowly to Italian","2a":"Singles - 5-6 rm 2-family - 4-5 rms","2b":"Frame Frame","2c":"35-40 yrs 25 yrs","2d":"Only fair Fair","2e":"100% 97%","2f":"80% 35-40%","2g":"$2200-3200 ","2h":"$2200-3200 0% $3800-4500 0%","2i":"Aug 1939 $2200-3200 0% $3800-4500 0%","2j":"Fair Fair","2k":"Stable - possibly down Stable - possibly down","2l":"$25 - 32.50 $18 - 25 per un","2m":"$25 - 32.50 0% $18-25 0%","2n":"Aug 1939 $25-32.50 0% $18-25 0%","2o":"Fairly good Fairly good","2p":"Stable  Stable","4a":"(See Census Tract Map Attached)","4b":"150","5a":"","5b":"60"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-81.58537,41.567473],[-81.583124,41.56806],[-81.57528,41.56822],[-81.575138,41.569153],[-81.572072,41.570487],[-81.571287,41.571074],[-81.569291,41.571127],[-81.569326,41.572007],[-81.564727,41.572034],[-81.561126,41.573314],[-81.556919,41.574888],[-81.554174,41.576115],[-81.55364,41.575368],[-81.551286,41.576248],[-81.550966,41.576808],[-81.550859,41.577475],[-81.551536,41.578168],[-81.552534,41.579128],[-81.552106,41.580275],[-81.551215,41.580942],[-81.550146,41.581288],[-81.549682,41.581502],[-81.549724,41.582871],[-81.548746,41.58184],[-81.547605,41.580631],[-81.546987,41.579564],[-81.546274,41.578213],[-81.549412,41.578106],[-81.549649,41.577288],[-81.549649,41.576008],[-81.553072,41.574265],[-81.55388,41.574585],[-81.554023,41.574728],[-81.555972,41.573874],[-81.558158,41.572807],[-81.559252,41.572523],[-81.560392,41.571954],[-81.562151,41.571563],[-81.563958,41.570958],[-81.565051,41.570745],[-81.566192,41.570745],[-81.568711,41.570887],[-81.568569,41.569962],[-81.569092,41.569073],[-81.571658,41.569358],[-81.571754,41.567188],[-81.575224,41.567473],[-81.575461,41.564628],[-81.580358,41.564521],[-81.580548,41.562707],[-81.585016,41.5626],[-81.585206,41.559826],[-81.591861,41.559328],[-81.592099,41.559435],[-81.592051,41.561569],[-81.588819,41.563561],[-81.588866,41.565979],[-81.585682,41.566157],[-81.58537,41.567473]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"D26","holc_grade":"D","area_description_data":{"0":"Greater Cleveland","2":"90 ","3":"0 - -","5":"1","6":"Not available","8":"This 4th grade area (entire south boundary) abutting industrial and railroad property) was laid out 35-40 yrs. ago and developed with cheap single homes mixed with a few converted two-family structures ranging from 1-1 1/2 to 2 sty. dwellings.

Originally settled by Germans and Irish, it slowly bowed to Cleveland's expansion and infiltration of other foreign peoples.

The Roumanians settles around W. 48th St. district-- the Hungarian and Italian people located between W. 54th and W. 73rd Sts., (largely north of Detroit Ave.) Several old German families are still found along the eastern and central part of the area. The earliest developments of this area was along W. 28th and W. 29th Sts. and here many of the homes are 75 to 80 yrs. old; now fully developed, the area was built up with large 2 sty. single dwellings, many of which were converted into 2-3 family units and rooming houses; (there are a few 1 1/2 sty. homes on each street interspersed with the large converted type). The houses along W. 58th St. and west thereof are in better repair condition--are more modern--have full basements and average 25-30 yrs. Franklin Ave. was once the fashionable district of the west side; two family homes (with round basements) on this street sell for around $3500-$5500 singles and doubles without basements or round cellars from $1800-3500. The main business section of west-side Cleveland is located here; retail business shops run solidly along Lorain, Detroit, Fulton and W. 25th St. There was a small colored settlement in the northeast peak of this area but there homes were razed for the new Main Ave. bridge and also for the Slum Clearance Project. Proximity to Public Square and to industry and because of convenience to transportation, schools, stores, churches, etc. this area will remain attractive to present type of occupants. Transition is to retail stores, light manufacturing establishments and rooming houses.

The old residents moved to Lakewood, Rocky River and Bay Village. The area was developed generally with large single homes on 20-40' lots with a few 50' in width on Kenilworth Ave. The industrial and commercial expansion of the \"west side\" was keenly felt by this area. Now bordered by railroads, factories and steel mills on the north and east boundaries and traversed by 3 main heavy trafficked arteries (W. 25th-Scranton-W. 14th St.) this once fashionable and peaceful residential community rapidly gave ground to its inescapable transition. The fair residential parts or what is left of them lie in the southwest corner (west of W. 25th St.) and along Kenilworth in the north part of area; the poorest sections, along the eastern boundary. The large single homes are generally located on Scranton, W. 14th St., Kenilworth and Starkweather. Briefly, the area consists of: 40% large and small single homes, 40% two-family type (90% of which were converted doubles) and 20% three or more family unit dwellings; the latter type is crowded with two homes on one lot--5 homes on 3 lots, etc. Such streets as Vega, Jennings, Scranton, Walton and Seymour were once the area's most fashionable districts. Retail business-stores run solid on W. 25th and very heavy on Scranton and W. 14th Cleveland's Municipal Hospital (largest city hospital in country) is located on Scranton. One of Cleveland's five Govt. Slum Clearance Projects (500 families) is situated in eastern section of area. The Jennings Rd. Project (WPA) when completed, will relieve the heavy traffic congestion on W. 25th St. The area has a 10% vacancy with many uninhabitable units especially in the north-eastern section; vandalism prevails most strongly here. Rental collections are difficult and WPA and Relief Rolls are very heavy.

Approximately 30 homes are located in this area; developed about 40%; no further development is anticipated for white ownership.","9":"Garfield Hts.
