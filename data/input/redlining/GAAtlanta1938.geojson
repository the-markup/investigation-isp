The apartments have good rental demand since occupants escape city taxation. The wide range in family incomes is due to presence of a few well-to-do families who still occupy homes in the area, plus the tenants in the apartments who earn good salaries, ranging downward to lower income groups along Peachtree Avenue, Woodland Street and Lookout Place. From home-ownership standpoint, property, if acquired in this area, should be sold; however, in cases where zoning and restrictions permit, it might be better to hold for higher values occasioned by use of property for business purposes.
