Removal of Ford plant from Highland Park was unfavorable to the area.  On Margaret and on Savannah there are 10 4-flats at from $11,000 to $16,500 and a few on Robinwood in the $16,500 range.  On Golden Gate and on Hollywood 2-flats range $10,000 to $15,000.  Through the area north of Savannah, $2500 properties may be found right among the $10,000 homes.  Lack of restriction enforcement population shifting make this a 3rd grade area.  *See explanation sheet for Area Descriptions.","9":"Detroit, Michigan 3rd C14 3-1-39","10":"","71":"8-1939","72":"32.71 Assess fair","1a":"Slowly  ","1b":"Business, professional, clerk, mechanics $1500-4000","1c":"No ","1d":"No","1e":"Labor, moderately","2a":"Singles 2-flats  4-flats 10%","2b":"Frame Brick veneer","2c":"Up to 20 yrs Up to 20 yrs","2d":"Fair to good Fair to good","2e":"98% 98%","2f":"75% 75%","2g":"1800-8000 3700-7200","2h":"2400-11,000 25 4600-9000 20","2i":"March 1, 1939 2200-10,000  4200-8000 -10","2j":"$1700-9400 3500-7500","2k":"Firm Weak","2l":"13-60 18-45","2m":"17-82 25 22-55 20","2n":"March 1, 1939 15-75 -10 20-50 -10","2o":"$15-65 $15-40","2p":"Firm Weak","4a":"14*","4b":"0","5a":"7  HOLC Loans: Outstanding-184, paid off 5","5b":"33 singles, 22 2-flats"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-83.062956,42.430828],[-83.063066,42.433136],[-83.06769,42.432976],[-83.073908,42.432976],[-83.07696,42.43295],[-83.082837,42.432775],[-83.082893,42.443923],[-83.075009,42.444143],[-83.07495,42.440109],[-83.071563,42.440197],[-83.071622,42.442784],[-83.069364,42.442784],[-83.069245,42.440284],[-83.053737,42.44046],[-83.054272,42.447782],[-83.041496,42.448002],[-83.041556,42.44616],[-83.044051,42.446072],[-83.043992,42.444494],[-83.04928,42.44445],[-83.049102,42.440591],[-83.040424,42.440806],[-83.04031,42.436933],[-83.039967,42.433018],[-83.039853,42.427923],[-83.05092,42.427671],[-83.062728,42.427207],[-83.062956,42.430828]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C15","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"0":"Detroit, Michigan","2":"98 2","3":"50; scattered production from Robinwood north between Shields & Bloom Frame $4000 Moderately","5":"2","6":"Selective","8":"Harned to Wexford between Lants and the 7-Mile Rd. is above the area average, as is Fenelon to Moonart between Lantz and the 7-Mile Rd.
